{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. POST request with empty body. No query string parameters. This is a stateless endpoint that likely relies on session cookies or browser headers (Accept-Language) to determine which language resource to load.","response_structure":"Returns empty response body with 200 status code. This is unusual - typically language loading endpoints return JSON with translation keys/values or redirect. The empty response suggests either: (1) language data is set server-side in session/cookies, (2) this is a state-change endpoint that primes language selection for subsequent requests, or (3) the capture occurred during an error state.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language/localization management. Part of the Sobranie (Macedonian Parliament) website's internationalization system. The endpoint name 'LoadLanguage' suggests it initializes or switches language context. Being under /Infrastructure path indicates this is a core system utility rather than content-specific endpoint. The empty response is noteworthy - successful language endpoints typically return either language pack data or confirmation. This may be a lazy-loading trigger or session initializer. Testing recommendations: (1) Check response headers for Set-Cookie or Content-Language, (2) Monitor subsequent requests to see if language preference persists, (3) Test with different Accept-Language headers, (4) Verify if this endpoint must be called before accessing localized content.","other":"Endpoint categorization: System/Infrastructure utility. Security considerations: Public endpoint with no authentication visible, appropriate for language selection. May be vulnerable to CSRF if it modifies server-side state without tokens. Performance note: Empty response suggests minimal overhead. Integration pattern: Likely called during application bootstrap or language switcher UI interaction. Related endpoints to discover: /Infrastructure/GetLanguages, /Infrastructure/SetLanguage, or similar localization endpoints. The www.sobranie.mk domain indicates this is the official Macedonian Parliament website, suggesting this infrastructure supports at least Macedonian and potentially Albanian, English, or other minority languages per North Macedonia's language policies."}
