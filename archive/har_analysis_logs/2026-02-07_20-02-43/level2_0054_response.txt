{"route_type": "GET", "method_name": "getSittingPage", "parameters": "None - Static HTML resource request with no query parameters or request body", "response_structure": "text/html - Returns empty HTML content (0 bytes). This appears to be either a placeholder page, a page that loads content dynamically via JavaScript, or a deprecated/unused endpoint that returns no content.", "documentation_notes": "This endpoint retrieves a sitting (parliamentary session) page from the Moldova scripts directory. The path structure '/Scripts/Moldova/sitting/sitting.html' suggests this is a static HTML file rather than a dynamic API endpoint. The empty response indicates this may be: 1) A frame/container page that loads actual content via AJAX/JavaScript, 2) A deprecated endpoint no longer serving content, 3) An error condition returning empty content instead of proper error response. The 'Moldova' directory name is notable and may indicate content related to Moldovan parliamentary procedures or a specific system module name. This does not appear to be a RESTful API endpoint but rather a web page resource.", "other": "URL Pattern: /Scripts/{module}/sitting/sitting.html - Suggests there may be similar paths for other modules or sections. The fact this returns 200 OK with empty body rather than 404 indicates the file exists but has no content. This is unusual behavior and may warrant investigation. The request contains no authentication headers or tokens in the sanitized version. Path components 'Scripts' and 'Moldova' suggest this may be part of a legacy system or specific parliamentary module. Recommend checking browser network tab for subsequent XHR/fetch requests that may load actual content into this page."}
