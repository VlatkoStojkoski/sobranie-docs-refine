{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters in request body or query string. May accept parameters in request headers (such as Accept-Language) or cookies for language selection. Endpoint appears to be designed to load/set language preferences for the application.", "response_structure": "Empty response body with 200 OK status. This suggests the endpoint may set server-side session state or cookies rather than returning data. Alternatively, could be returning an empty JSON object/array that was sanitized to empty string.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language management in the Sobranie (Macedonian Parliament) website. POST method suggests it sets/saves language preference rather than retrieves it. The empty response indicates side-effects only (session/cookie modification) or possible error/edge case. This is likely part of the multilingual support system. Users would typically call this when switching between Macedonian, Albanian, Turkish, English, or other supported languages on the site.", "other": "Endpoint path structure suggests ASP.NET MVC or similar framework (Infrastructure controller, LoadLanguage action). Empty response is unusual for a load operation - typically would expect language data or confirmation. May need to examine request headers, cookies, or FormData that wasn't captured in sanitized body. Could also be an initialization endpoint called on page load that primes language settings server-side. Consider testing with Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data with language parameters."}
