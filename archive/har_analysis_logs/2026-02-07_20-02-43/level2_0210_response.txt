{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the remote method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): 1 for Macedonian language selection, likely supports multiple language codes; Month (integer, required): month number 1-12, specifies which month's agenda to retrieve; Year (integer, required): four-digit year, used to retrieve agenda for specific year-month combination","response_structure":"Empty response body returned in this capture. Expected structure unknown but likely returns array or object containing monthly agenda items with parliamentary sessions, meetings, or scheduled events. Response format is JSON based on Content-Type header.","documentation_notes":"This is a routing endpoint that acts as a method dispatcher for the Sobranie (Macedonian Parliament) website. The '/Routing/MakePostRequest' path suggests a generic RPC-style endpoint where different methods are invoked via the 'methodName' parameter rather than RESTful resource-based URLs. The empty response for January 2026 indicates either no scheduled events exist for that future date, the method returned null/empty legitimately, or there was an error that wasn't reflected in the HTTP status. The LanguageId parameter indicates multilingual support - value 1 appears to be Macedonian (mk). This pattern suggests other parliamentary data retrieval methods likely use the same routing endpoint with different methodName values.","other":"The request queries a future date (January 2026) which explains the empty response - no agenda items would exist that far in advance. Testing with current or recent past dates would likely yield populated responses. The MakePostRequest routing pattern is unusual for modern APIs but common in older .NET WebForms or MVC applications. Other potential methodName values to explore: GetWeeklyAgenda, GetDailyAgenda, GetSessionDetails, GetMPDetails, etc. Security consideration: no authentication headers observed, suggesting this is public data. The generic routing endpoint may be vulnerable to method enumeration attacks."}
