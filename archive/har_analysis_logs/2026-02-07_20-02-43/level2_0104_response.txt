{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "None - endpoint accepts POST request with no body parameters, no query parameters, and no URL path parameters", "response_structure": "Empty response body with 200 OK status. Content-Type is application/json but actual response is empty string or null", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for loading language resources. Part of the /Infrastructure namespace which likely handles system-level operations. The endpoint returns successfully but with no content, suggesting it may: (1) perform a side-effect operation like setting session language preferences, (2) trigger server-side language resource loading, (3) be a legacy/deprecated endpoint that no longer returns data, or (4) require specific headers or cookies to function properly. The empty response could indicate the language data is stored in session/cookies rather than returned directly.", "other": "Endpoint located under /Infrastructure path suggesting it's part of internal system functionality rather than public-facing API. The LoadLanguage name implies internationalization (i18n) functionality for the Sobranie (Parliament) website. May be called during initial page load or language switching. The POST method is unusual for a 'Load' operation which typically uses GET - this could indicate state modification on server side. No authentication or authorization errors suggest it's publicly accessible. Consider checking response headers for Set-Cookie or other session-related data that might not appear in the body."}
