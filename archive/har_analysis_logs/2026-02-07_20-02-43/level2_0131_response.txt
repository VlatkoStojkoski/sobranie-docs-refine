{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value 1 observed), 'Month' (integer, value 1 for January observed), 'Year' (integer, 2026 observed). Language likely enum where 1=Macedonian or default language. Month is 1-12. Year is four-digit integer.","response_structure":"Expected JSON array or object with calendar events, but response was empty in this capture. Empty response may indicate no events for January 2026, or endpoint returns empty for future dates. Typical calendar service would return array of event objects with properties like date, title, description, event type.","documentation_notes":"This is an ASP.NET ASMX web service endpoint (legacy .NET web service). Path structure '/Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx/' indicates this is under a Moldova module/section. The service retrieves custom calendar events filtered by language, month, and year. Empty response could mean: (1) no events scheduled for January 2026, (2) endpoint doesn't return future events beyond certain threshold, (3) 'custom events' may be user-specific and require authentication context not visible in HAR, or (4) this event type is rarely populated. Content-Type is application/json despite ASMX typically returning XML, suggesting JsonScriptService attribute or modern ASMX/JSON configuration.","other":"Service naming suggests there may be related endpoints like GetEventsCalendar (non-custom), GetEventDetails, etc. The 'custom' qualifier implies distinction from regular parliamentary events. Consider testing with current/past dates to validate response structure. Language parameter suggests multi-language support - test with different values (likely 1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian based on North Macedonia's official languages). ASMX services typically have discoverable WSDL at CalendarService.asmx?WSDL."}
