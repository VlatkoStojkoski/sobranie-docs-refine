{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters in URL query string or request body. This endpoint appears to accept POST requests with no payload. May rely on session cookies, authentication headers, or other implicit context (e.g., Accept-Language header) to determine which language data to return.", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned (0 bytes). Status 200 indicates successful processing despite empty payload. This could mean: (1) language data is stored in session/cookie instead of response body, (2) endpoint side-effect only (sets language preference server-side), (3) response was legitimately empty for this particular request context, or (4) language data already cached client-side.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure utility endpoint for language management in the Sobranie (Parliament) system. The /Infrastructure namespace suggests this is a core system service rather than domain-specific functionality. LoadLanguage naming indicates this retrieves or initializes language/localization data for the application. Despite empty response in this capture, the endpoint likely returns language resource strings, translations, or locale configuration under normal circumstances. The POST method suggests this may trigger server-side state changes (e.g., setting user language preference) rather than pure data retrieval. Common pattern in .NET/ASP.NET applications for loading localized resources.", "other": "Endpoint follows PascalCase convention typical of ASP.NET MVC/WebAPI applications. No authentication errors (401/403) suggest either public endpoint or authenticated session already established. Empty response may indicate: subsequent requests in session would use selected language, or client-side JavaScript polls this endpoint to synchronize language state. Recommend testing with different Accept-Language headers, language query parameters, or examining Set-Cookie headers in response. Path structure suggests possible related endpoints: /Infrastructure/SetLanguage, /Infrastructure/GetLanguages, etc."}
