{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value 1 observed), 'Month' (integer, range 1-12, value 1 observed for January), 'Year' (integer, value 2026 observed). All three fields appear required for the calendar query.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (HTTP 200). Expected structure unknown - may return calendar events array when data exists, or empty response indicates no events for January 2026. Content-Type is application/json suggesting JSON array or object when populated.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services). Path structure '/Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx/GetCustomEventsCalendar' suggests country-specific service (Moldova) for parliamentary calendar events. Language parameter likely controls localization (1 may represent Macedonian or English). Service retrieves custom calendar events for specified month/year combination. Empty response for future date (2026) suggests no events scheduled or service only returns current/past events.","other":"Domain sobranie.mk is Assembly of North Macedonia official website. Service appears part of parliamentary information system. ASMX technology is deprecated but still in use. Other potential endpoints may exist at /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx/ with similar patterns. Consider testing with current month/year for populated response. May have sister endpoints for regular events vs custom events. Language codes and valid ranges unknown - testing needed."}
