{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetSittingDetails","parameters":"SittingId (string/UUID, required) - Unique identifier for a parliamentary sitting (e.g., 'c5794cfb-0515-47c4-bd40-459c2874ed94'); LanguageId (integer, required) - Language selector for localization (1 appears to be primary language, likely Macedonian); MethodName (string, required) - Internal routing parameter specifying the backend method to invoke","response_structure":"Empty response in this capture - likely indicates no sitting details found for the provided SittingId, or a data availability issue. Expected structure when data exists would typically include: sitting metadata (date, time, session number), agenda items, participants/MPs present, voting records, transcript/minutes links, and related documents. Response format is JSON based on Content-Type header.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint (/Routing/MakePostRequest) that acts as an RPC-style gateway - the actual method being called is determined by the MethodName parameter in the request body rather than the URL path. This pattern suggests a single entry point for multiple backend operations. The empty response may indicate: (1) invalid/non-existent SittingId, (2) data not yet published for this sitting, (3) authorization/permission issue, or (4) the sitting details are genuinely empty. The UUID format for SittingId suggests a database-generated identifier. LanguageId=1 likely corresponds to Macedonian as the primary official language, with other values potentially representing Albanian (2) or English translations.","other":"API belongs to sobranie.mk (Assembly of North Macedonia parliament website). The routing pattern is unconventional for REST APIs - uses POST for what appears to be a read operation (GET semantics). No authentication headers observed in this request. The method name 'GetSittingDetails' suggests parliamentary sitting/session information retrieval. Consider testing with different LanguageId values (1, 2, potentially 3) to discover supported languages. Need to capture successful responses with valid SittingIds to document complete response schema. Related methods likely exist: GetSittings (list), GetSittingAgenda, GetSittingTranscript, etc. following similar naming conventions."}
