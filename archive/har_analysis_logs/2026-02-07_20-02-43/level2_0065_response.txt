{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters observed in this request. The endpoint accepts POST requests with no query string parameters and no request body. May accept parameters in cookies or headers for session/authentication context, or the language preference may be determined server-side from session state.", "response_structure": "Returns empty response body with 200 OK status. This suggests either: (1) the endpoint performs a server-side state change without returning data, (2) the response sets language preferences via cookies/headers rather than body content, or (3) the captured response represents a no-op or default state where no language data needed to be loaded.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language loading/switching functionality. Part of the /Infrastructure namespace which likely contains system-level utilities. The endpoint name suggests it loads or switches the user interface language for the sobranie.mk (Parliament of North Macedonia) website. Despite being a POST endpoint, it returns no content, indicating it probably sets session state, cookies, or server-side preferences rather than returning language data. The actual language selection may be passed through cookies, headers (Accept-Language), or session identifiers rather than explicit parameters. Common pattern for language switching endpoints that update user preferences without returning confirmation data.", "other": "Endpoint belongs to infrastructure/utility layer rather than core API functionality. May be called automatically on page load or language selection. The empty response suggests this is a side-effect endpoint that modifies state. To fully document this endpoint, would need to examine: request headers (especially Accept-Language, cookies), response headers (Set-Cookie for language preference), and whether this endpoint is called with client-side context that determines language. The POST method suggests it's meant to change state rather than just retrieve language data."}
