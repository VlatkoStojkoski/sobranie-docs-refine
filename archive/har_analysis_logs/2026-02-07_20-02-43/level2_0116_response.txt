{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. It appears to be a POST request that may rely on session/cookie data or headers to determine which language to load.","response_structure":"Empty response body. Status 200 indicates success, but no JSON data is returned. This suggests the endpoint may set cookies, session state, or trigger server-side language preference storage without returning data to the client.","documentation_notes":"This is an infrastructure endpoint for language loading/switching functionality. The empty response with 200 status suggests this is likely a fire-and-forget operation that updates server-side state (session, cookies, or user preferences) rather than returning language data. The actual language selection may be determined by headers (Accept-Language), cookies, or other contextual information not visible in the request body. Common pattern in multi-language web applications where language preference is stored server-side and subsequent requests return localized content based on that preference.","other":"Endpoint path structure indicates it's part of an Infrastructure module/namespace, suggesting internal system functionality rather than public API. The POST method is unusual for a 'Load' operation which typically would be GET, indicating this performs a state-changing operation (likely saving language preference). May be called via AJAX during language selector interaction on the frontend. Response headers and cookies should be examined to understand full behavior."}
