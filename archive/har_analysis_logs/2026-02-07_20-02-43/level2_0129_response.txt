{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body parameters. It appears to be a simple POST request without payload.","response_structure":"Empty JSON response (status 200). The response body is empty, suggesting either no language data was available, an error occurred silently, or the endpoint has side effects (like setting session/cookie data) rather than returning data directly.","documentation_notes":"This is an Infrastructure utility endpoint for loading/setting language preferences. The endpoint name suggests it should load language resources or configuration, but returns empty content. This could indicate: (1) Language data is set via cookies/session rather than response body, (2) The endpoint triggers server-side language initialization, (3) A client-side state management mechanism is used, or (4) The request failed silently. The POST method suggests it may accept language selection parameters in other contexts, though none are present in this capture. Part of the Infrastructure namespace/module of the sobranie.mk API.","other":"Endpoint path structure follows pattern: /[Module]/[Action]. This is likely part of ASP.NET MVC or similar framework routing. The empty response with 200 status is unusual - typically would expect either language data JSON or at minimum a success confirmation object. May need to examine response headers for Set-Cookie or other session management headers to understand full behavior. This endpoint might be called during application initialization or language switching workflows."}
