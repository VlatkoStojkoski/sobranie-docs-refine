{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllCommitteesForFilter","parameters":"methodName (string, required): The API method to invoke, value 'GetAllCommitteesForFilter'. languageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization, value 1 observed (likely Macedonian language).","response_structure":"Unknown - request returned HTTP 500 error with empty response body. Expected structure likely contains array of committee objects with properties such as committee ID, name, description, members count, or similar parliamentary committee metadata.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that dispatches to different backend methods based on the methodName parameter. The GetAllCommitteesForFilter method appears designed to retrieve parliamentary committees data, possibly with filtering capabilities. The 500 error suggests either server-side issue, missing authentication, invalid session, or the method may require additional filter parameters not provided in this request. The naming convention suggests there may be related methods like GetCommitteeById, GetCommitteeMembers, etc. The languageId parameter indicates multi-language support in the API.","other":"Error response investigation needed. The endpoint follows a generic proxy/router pattern rather than RESTful design. Consider testing with additional parameters such as filter criteria, pagination (page, pageSize), sorting options, or date ranges. May require authentication headers or session cookies not visible in sanitized request. The sobranie.mk domain indicates this is the Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia's website. Similar methodName values to explore: GetAllCommittees, GetCommitteeDetails, GetCommitteeMeetings, GetCommitteeMembers."}
