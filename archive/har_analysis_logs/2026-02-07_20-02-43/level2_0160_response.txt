{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllStructuresForFilter","parameters":"languageId (integer, required) - Language identifier for localization (1 appears to be default/primary language). methodName (string, required) - Specifies the backend method to invoke, in this case 'GetAllStructuresForFilter'.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned. Expected structure unknown - may return array of structure objects with filtering metadata when data exists, or endpoint may have failed silently. Typical structure responses might include: id, name, type, parent relationships, or hierarchical data.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that acts as a proxy/dispatcher to backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the POST body. This pattern suggests a single-endpoint API gateway design where multiple backend services are accessed through one URL. The endpoint path '/Routing/MakePostRequest' confirms this dispatcher pattern. GetAllStructuresForFilter suggests retrieval of organizational or parliamentary structures with filtering capabilities, likely for dropdown menus or search filters in the UI. The empty response may indicate: no structures configured, database empty, authorization failure, or server-side error without proper error handling.","other":"Part of sobranie.mk (Macedonian Parliament) website API. The generic routing pattern makes API discovery more difficult as all methods share the same endpoint URL. To discover other available methods, would need to examine client-side JavaScript or additional HAR captures. The languageId parameter suggests multi-language support (likely Macedonian, Albanian, English based on North Macedonia's linguistic context). Response being completely empty rather than returning error object or empty array suggests potential API reliability issues or incomplete implementation."}
