{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: Language (integer, value 1 observed), Month (integer, 1-12 range expected, value 1 observed for January), Year (integer, value 2026 observed). All three fields appear required based on structure.","response_structure":"Empty response returned for the test query (January 2026). Expected structure likely JSON array or object containing calendar events when data exists. Status 200 indicates successful processing despite empty result.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services) for retrieving custom calendar events from North Macedonia Parliament system. The '/Moldova/' path segment is notable - likely refers to internal routing or historical naming. Language parameter suggests multilingual support (1 may indicate Macedonian or English). Empty response for future date (2026) suggests no events scheduled or endpoint returns empty for dates without data. Service follows ASMX convention of exposing methods via POST to .asmx/MethodName paths with JSON payloads.","other":"Domain sobranie.mk is North Macedonia's Parliament website. ASMX is legacy technology (pre-WCF), suggesting older API implementation. The empty response for 2026 could indicate: (1) no events exist for that period, (2) future dates beyond certain threshold return empty, or (3) test data limitation. Consider testing with current/past dates for populated responses. Authentication appears not required based on direct access. Content-Type application/json indicates JSON serialization despite ASMX traditionally using XML/SOAP."}
