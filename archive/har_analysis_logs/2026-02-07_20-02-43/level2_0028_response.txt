{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. The language selection may be determined by session state, cookies, or Accept-Language headers rather than explicit parameters.","response_structure":"Empty JSON response - Status 200 with no content in response body. This suggests the endpoint performs a server-side action (likely setting language preference in session/cookie) rather than returning data to the client.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language management. Located under /Infrastructure/ path suggesting internal/utility functionality. The empty response indicates this is likely a state-changing operation that stores language preference server-side. Frontend probably calls this to switch the user's interface language, with the actual language identifier passed via headers, cookies, or session context rather than request body. Subsequent page loads or API calls would then use the stored language preference. This pattern is common for session-based language switching where the preference persists across requests.","other":"Endpoint naming follows PascalCase convention consistent with ASP.NET MVC/Web API patterns. The Infrastructure namespace suggests this is part of core system functionality rather than domain-specific features. May be triggered by language selector UI component. Consider checking for Set-Cookie headers in actual HAR to understand how language preference is persisted. Related endpoints might include GetCurrentLanguage or GetAvailableLanguages under same namespace."}
