{"route_type": "GET", "method_name": "singleNewsInstance", "parameters": "None visible in this request. However, the path suggests this is likely a template/partial HTML file that may be loaded dynamically and populated with data via JavaScript. The '.min.html' extension indicates this is a minified HTML template. Typical usage would involve parameters passed via JavaScript when instantiating the template, not as URL query parameters.", "response_structure": "Empty HTML response (0 bytes). This appears to be a minified HTML template file that serves as a client-side component. The empty response could indicate: (1) the template is truly empty/minimal, (2) it's meant to be populated dynamically via JavaScript, (3) it's a placeholder for Angular/React/Vue component rendering, or (4) this is an error state where the template failed to load properly.", "documentation_notes": "This endpoint serves a client-side HTML template for displaying single news instances. The file is located in /scripts/news/ directory, suggesting it's part of a news module. The '.min.html' extension is unusual - typically minification applies to .js and .css files. This could be part of a client-side templating system where HTML fragments are loaded on-demand. The actual news content would likely be fetched from a separate API endpoint (possibly JSON) and then rendered into this template. To discover the full API, look for: (1) JavaScript files that reference this template, (2) JSON/API endpoints that provide news data, (3) parameters used when this template is instantiated in the browser.", "other": "File path structure indicates a modular architecture with scripts organized by feature (news). The empty response warrants further investigation - check browser console for errors, examine JavaScript that loads this template, and monitor network requests when news articles are loaded. This may be part of a single-page application (SPA) architecture. Related endpoints to investigate: /api/news/, /scripts/news/*.js files that might load data into this template."}
