{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters required in request body or query string. This endpoint accepts a POST request with no payload.", "response_structure": "Returns empty response body with HTTP 200 status. Content-Type is application/json but body is empty, suggesting either: (1) successful execution with no data to return, (2) language data loaded server-side into session/cache, or (3) potential error condition being masked as success.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for loading language resources. Located under /Infrastructure namespace suggesting system-level functionality. The empty response despite JSON content-type indicates this may be a side-effect operation that loads language configurations server-side (possibly into session state, application cache, or user preferences) rather than returning data to client. The POST method suggests this triggers an action rather than retrieving data. May be called during user session initialization, language switching, or page load to establish localization context. No authentication tokens visible in this sample but endpoint likely requires valid session.", "other": "Endpoint naming convention follows Pascal case (LoadLanguage). Part of Infrastructure module suggesting core system functionality separate from business logic. Empty response pattern is unusual for modern APIs - consider if this is legacy design or intentional fire-and-forget operation. May need to test with different Accept-Language headers or session contexts to understand full behavior. Could be predecessor to more RESTful language selection endpoints."}
