{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "None - This endpoint accepts POST requests with no parameters in the request body or query string. The language selection may be determined by session state, cookies, or HTTP headers (e.g., Accept-Language).", "response_structure": "Empty JSON response or empty body with 200 status code. The endpoint returns successfully but provides no data in the response body, suggesting it may set server-side session state or cookies rather than returning language data directly.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language loading/initialization. Part of the /Infrastructure path namespace which likely handles system-level configuration and setup operations. The endpoint name suggests it loads or initializes language settings for the user session. The empty response with successful status indicates this is likely a state-setting operation rather than a data retrieval endpoint. Common pattern: user language preferences may be stored in session/cookies after this call, with actual translations loaded separately. May be called during application initialization or when user changes language preference in the UI.", "other": "This appears to be a session management or initialization endpoint. The empty response pattern suggests side effects (session state changes, cookie setting) are the primary purpose. To fully understand this endpoint's behavior, would need to inspect: 1) Response headers for Set-Cookie directives, 2) Whether subsequent requests include language identifiers in cookies/headers, 3) If there's a corresponding GET endpoint that returns language data, 4) Whether this is called in conjunction with other Infrastructure endpoints during app bootstrap. The /Infrastructure namespace suggests there may be other related system endpoints for configuration management."}
