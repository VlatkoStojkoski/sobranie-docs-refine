{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "GetSittingDetails", "parameters": "SittingId (string, UUID format, required) - Unique identifier for a parliamentary sitting session (e.g., '27bf274e-2c3e-45cd-8b53-bd39a7d58bb5'); LanguageId (integer, required) - Language selection parameter (1 appears to be default, likely Macedonian)", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned. This could indicate: (1) No sitting details exist for the provided SittingId, (2) The sitting has no associated details yet, (3) An error condition that returns empty rather than error messages, or (4) The session/sitting may not be publicly accessible. Expected structure unknown - may include sitting date, time, agenda items, participants, session status, voting records, or transcripts when data exists.", "documentation_notes": "This endpoint uses a generic routing mechanism (/Routing/MakePostRequest) where the actual method is specified in the request body via 'MethodName' field. This is a non-RESTful RPC-style API pattern. The SittingId uses UUID format suggesting a modern database implementation. The empty response makes it difficult to determine the full capabilities - testing with known valid SittingIds would be necessary to document the complete response schema. The LanguageId parameter suggests multilingual support (likely Macedonian and Albanian as official languages, possibly English). Consider testing with LanguageId values 1, 2, and 3 to identify language mappings.", "other": "Related endpoints likely exist for: GetSittings (list all sittings), GetSittingAgenda, GetSittingVotes, GetSittingTranscripts. The generic routing pattern suggests many other methods may be available through the same /Routing/MakePostRequest endpoint. Security consideration: UUID-based identification may prevent enumeration attacks. The empty response could be a privacy/access control measure for non-public or future sittings. Recommend testing with historical sitting IDs to obtain populated response examples."}
