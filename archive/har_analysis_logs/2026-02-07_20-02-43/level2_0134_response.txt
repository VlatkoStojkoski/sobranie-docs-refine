{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "None - This endpoint accepts POST requests but does not require any request body parameters or query string parameters. The language context may be determined by session cookies, Accept-Language headers, or server-side session state rather than explicit parameters.", "response_structure": "Empty response body with HTTP 200 status. The endpoint returns application/json content-type but the actual payload is empty, suggesting this may be a state-setting endpoint that modifies server-side session or returns data through alternative mechanisms (cookies, headers) rather than response body.", "documentation_notes": "This Infrastructure/LoadLanguage endpoint appears to be part of the Macedonian Parliament (sobranie.mk) website's internationalization/localization system. Despite being a POST endpoint, it returns no visible data in the response body. Possible functions: (1) Initializes or switches language preferences in server-side session, (2) Sets language cookies for subsequent requests, (3) Preloads language resources server-side, (4) Returns empty on success with language state managed through Set-Cookie headers not captured in body. The empty response with 200 status indicates successful processing. This is likely called during page initialization or language switching actions. The Infrastructure namespace suggests it's a utility/system endpoint rather than domain-specific business logic.", "other": "The endpoint pattern suggests ASP.NET MVC architecture (Controller/Action structure). The lack of request/response data makes this difficult to fully reverse-engineer without examining response headers (particularly Set-Cookie) or subsequent requests that may rely on state set by this call. For complete API documentation, examine: response headers for session/language cookies, browser localStorage/sessionStorage changes, and any JavaScript that calls this endpoint to understand the full language-switching workflow."}
