{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. This endpoint accepts a POST request with no body, no query string parameters, and no visible authentication or session tokens in the sanitized data. It appears to be a stateless endpoint that may rely on cookies or headers (like Accept-Language) to determine which language data to load.","response_structure":"Returns an empty response body with HTTP 200 status and application/json content type. The empty JSON response could indicate: (1) successful operation with no data to return, (2) the language data is cached client-side, (3) the response sets cookies or headers not visible in sanitized HAR, or (4) this is an initialization endpoint that triggers server-side state without returning data.","documentation_notes":"This endpoint is part of the Infrastructure namespace/module of the sobranie.mk (Assembly of North Macedonia) website. The LoadLanguage method suggests it handles language/localization initialization or switching. The POST method is unusual for a 'Load' operation which would typically be GET, suggesting this may trigger server-side language preference storage or session state changes. The empty response combined with application/json content-type indicates the client may not expect data back, only a success confirmation. This could be called during application initialization or when a user changes language preferences.","other":"Base path: /Infrastructure/. This suggests a multi-tier API structure with Infrastructure handling cross-cutting concerns like localization. The empty response pattern may indicate this is part of a two-step process where LoadLanguage sets state and subsequent API calls return localized content. Worth investigating: (1) Response headers for Set-Cookie or custom headers, (2) Whether subsequent requests return different language content, (3) If there's a corresponding GET endpoint for retrieving language data, (4) Common usage pattern in the application flow."}
