{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters in URL query string or request body. May accept parameters via headers (e.g., Accept-Language) or cookies for language preference. Endpoint appears designed to load language resources but was called without explicit parameters.", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned with HTTP 200 status. Expected structure unknown - may return language resource JSON object, translation dictionary, or locale configuration when properly parameterized. Current empty response suggests either: (1) default/fallback behavior when no language specified, (2) cached response, or (3) language already loaded in session.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language/localization management in sobranie.mk (Assembly of North Macedonia parliament website). Part of Infrastructure namespace/module. Purpose: Load or initialize language resources for internationalization. Empty response with successful status suggests this may be a fire-and-forget initialization call or session-based language loader. Likely supports Macedonian and Albanian as official languages, potentially English and other languages. May work in conjunction with client-side language switching mechanisms. Consider testing with Accept-Language header or language parameter in subsequent requests.", "other": "Content-Type is application/json despite empty body. Endpoint naming convention uses PascalCase (LoadLanguage). Infrastructure path suggests this is part of core system functionality rather than business logic. May be called during application initialization or language switching. Consider investigating: (1) Cookie or session state changes after this call, (2) Subsequent requests that might depend on language being 'loaded', (3) Alternative calling patterns with language codes (e.g., mk, sq, en), (4) Whether this sets server-side session language preference."}
