{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. This is a POST request to /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage with no query parameters and no request body.","response_structure":"Returns HTTP 200 with Content-Type application/json. Response body is empty, suggesting either an error condition, initialization endpoint, or the language data is cached/returned through other means (cookies, headers).","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language loading functionality. The empty response is unusual for a LoadLanguage endpoint - typically would expect language strings, locale data, or translation resources. May be used for session initialization or preference setting rather than data retrieval. Could also be a configuration endpoint that sets server-side state without returning data. The endpoint name suggests it's part of the infrastructure/system layer rather than business logic.","other":"Part of the /Infrastructure namespace which likely contains system-level utilities. Empty response with 200 status could indicate: (1) successful state change operation, (2) language data returned via alternative channel (Set-Cookie header, etc), (3) client-side cached data with server validation, or (4) endpoint called prematurely/incorrectly. Consider checking response headers for language-related cookies or cache directives. May need to be called with specific parameters or after authentication to receive actual data."}
