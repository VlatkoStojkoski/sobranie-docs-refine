{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"Request body (JSON): { \"model\": { \"Language\": integer (1 = language code, likely Macedonian/Albanian selector), \"Month\": integer (1-12, calendar month), \"Year\": integer (full year e.g. 2026) } }. No query parameters. Content-Type: application/json.","response_structure":"Empty response body received in test call. Expected structure unknown - likely returns array of calendar events or empty array when no events exist for the specified month/year. Content-Type: application/json. Status: 200 OK.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint for retrieving custom calendar events from the Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie) system. The service is located at /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx which appears to be a legacy ASMX web service path. The method GetCustomEventsCalendar accepts a model object with Language, Month, and Year parameters to filter events. Language parameter value 1 suggests a numeric enumeration for language selection (possibly 1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian based on North Macedonia's official languages). The empty response for January 2026 suggests either no events are scheduled, the future date has no data, or the endpoint returns empty arrays for no results rather than null. This endpoint likely supports the calendar/scheduling functionality on the parliament's public website.","other":"Service path structure suggests ASP.NET ASMX web service (legacy technology). The /Moldova/ path segment is notable - possibly indicates a legacy URL structure or system naming convention from the organization. Request tested with future date (2026-01) which returned empty, suggesting the API may have temporal data boundaries or simply no events scheduled. To fully document response structure, should test with historical dates known to have parliamentary events. The endpoint may be part of a larger CalendarService.asmx service with additional methods."}
