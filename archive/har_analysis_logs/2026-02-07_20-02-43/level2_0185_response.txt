{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. This is a POST request to /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage with no query string parameters and no request body. The endpoint appears to accept requests without any input data.","response_structure":"Returns HTTP 200 with Content-Type: application/json. Response body is empty. This suggests either: (1) the endpoint returns an empty JSON response under certain conditions, (2) the language data was not available at the time of the request, or (3) this may be a state-changing endpoint that doesn't return data but performs an action server-side (like setting a session variable or cookie for language preference).","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language management in the Sobranie (Macedonian Parliament) website. The endpoint name 'LoadLanguage' suggests it either retrieves language resources/translations or sets the active language for the session. Given the empty response, this may be a utility endpoint that: loads language settings into server-side session state, initializes language resources, or validates language availability. The /Infrastructure/ path prefix indicates this is part of the site's core infrastructure layer rather than public-facing content APIs. Without request parameters, it likely uses session state, cookies, or headers (like Accept-Language) to determine which language to load. The empty response suggests the actual language data may be returned through other means (cookies, session state) or this endpoint may be called as part of a larger initialization sequence.","other":"Notable characteristics: (1) POST method used despite no body data - suggests state-changing operation rather than data retrieval; (2) Infrastructure namespace suggests internal/utility function; (3) Empty response is unusual for a 'Load' operation - may indicate asynchronous processing or side-effect-only operation; (4) Could be paired with other language-related endpoints for retrieving actual translation data; (5) May rely on HTTP headers or cookies not visible in HAR capture for language selection; (6) Typical use case might be during page initialization or language switching in the UI."}
