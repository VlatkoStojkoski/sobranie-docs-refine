{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllSittings","parameters":"Page (integer, pagination): Current page number, default 1; Rows (integer, pagination): Items per page, default 10; LanguageId (integer, required): Language selector, value 1 observed; TypeId (integer, required): Sitting type filter, value 1 observed; CommitteeId (integer, optional): Filter by committee ID, accepts null; StatusId (integer, optional): Filter by status ID, accepts null; DateFrom (string/date, optional): Start date filter, accepts null; DateTo (string/date, optional): End date filter, accepts null; SessionId (integer, optional): Filter by session ID, accepts null; Number (integer, optional): Filter by sitting number, accepts null; StructureId (string/UUID, required): Structure identifier in UUID format, example '5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473'","response_structure":"Empty response body observed in this capture. Expected structure unknown but likely returns paginated list of parliamentary sittings with metadata based on method name and parameters. Typical structure would include total count, current page, and array of sitting objects with details like date, type, status, committee, session info.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that dispatches to different methods based on the 'methodName' field in the request body. The GetAllSittings method retrieves parliamentary sitting sessions with comprehensive filtering options including date ranges, committees, status, and type. Supports pagination through Page and Rows parameters. The StructureId appears to be a constant identifier for the parliamentary structure. LanguageId=1 likely represents Macedonian language. Empty response may indicate no results for given filters or error condition not reflected in HTTP status.","other":"The sobranie.mk site uses a centralized routing pattern where all API calls go through /Routing/MakePostRequest with the actual method specified in the request body. This is a RPC-style API design rather than RESTful. The empty response in this capture suggests either: (1) no sittings matched the filter criteria, (2) the StructureId may be invalid or test data, or (3) there was a server-side issue not reflected in the 200 status. Further captures with different parameters or successful responses would be needed to document the complete response schema. The UUID format for StructureId suggests this could be a multi-tenant or multi-branch parliamentary system."}
