{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"/GetQuestionDetails","parameters":"LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization (value: 1). QuestionId (string/UUID, required): Unique identifier for the parliamentary question in UUID format (example: '0e2039bb-7a4b-462b-9489-6bce448eeb2a').","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (status 200). Expected structure unknown - may indicate: question not found, authorization required, or endpoint expecting different parameters. Typical question details would include: question text, submission date, author/MP information, response status, answer text if available, related documents, category/topic classification.","documentation_notes":"This is a proxy/routing endpoint pattern where the actual API method is specified in the POST body's 'methodName' field rather than the URL path. The '/Routing/MakePostRequest' acts as a universal gateway that routes to '/GetQuestionDetails'. This architectural pattern suggests a single HTTP endpoint handling multiple internal methods. The empty response may indicate the question ID provided doesn't exist, access restrictions apply, or the endpoint requires authentication headers not captured. Parliamentary question details typically include metadata about inquiries submitted by members of parliament.","other":"Architectural pattern: POST-based RPC-style routing mechanism. The sobranie.mk system uses a routing proxy where all API calls go through '/Routing/MakePostRequest' with the actual method specified in the body. This differs from RESTful conventions. The LanguageId=1 likely represents Macedonian language. UUID format for QuestionId suggests modern database architecture. Empty response warrants investigation - may need session cookies, authentication tokens, or the specific QuestionId may be invalid/test data. Recommendation: test with known valid QuestionIds and check if authentication headers are required."}
