{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value: 1), 'Month' (integer, value: 1 for January), 'Year' (integer, value: 2026). All three fields appear required for calendar event retrieval.","response_structure":"Empty response returned (likely no events exist for January 2026). Expected structure unknown but likely returns array of calendar events when data exists. Content-Type is application/json.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint for Macedonian Parliament (sobranie.mk) calendar system. Path structure '/Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx' suggests ASP.NET Web Services (.asmx). Language parameter likely controls response language (1 may represent Macedonian or English). Service retrieves custom parliamentary events for specified month/year. Empty response for future date (2026) suggests no scheduled events or service only returns past/current events.","other":"Service location: /Moldova/services/ directory. Framework: ASP.NET ASMX (legacy web service technology). The 'Moldova' path segment is notable - may indicate specific parliament section or legacy naming. Standard ASMX POST pattern with JSON payload. Status 200 with empty body suggests successful request but no matching data rather than error condition."}
