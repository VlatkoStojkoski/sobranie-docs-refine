{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, e.g., 1 for language selection), 'Month' (integer, 1-12 for calendar month), 'Year' (integer, e.g., 2026 for calendar year). All three parameters appear required for the calendar query.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (status 200). Expected structure unknown - may return array of calendar events with date/time/description fields when data exists, or empty when no events scheduled for specified month/year. Content-Type is application/json suggesting JSON array or object structure.","documentation_notes":"ASMX SOAP/Web Service endpoint exposed as REST-like JSON API. Path structure '/Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx' indicates legacy ASP.NET Web Services framework. The 'GetCustomEventsCalendar' method retrieves custom/special events for the Macedonian parliament (sobranie.mk) calendar system. Empty response for January 2026 suggests either no events scheduled that far in future, or service returns empty for future dates beyond data availability. Language parameter suggests multilingual support (likely Macedonian/Albanian/English based on regional context). This appears to be a public-facing calendar API for parliamentary sessions, committee meetings, or official events.","other":"Service hosted under '/Moldova/' path segment which is unusual naming - possibly legacy path or internal codename. The .asmx extension indicates Microsoft ASMX web service technology (legacy, pre-WCF). Consider testing with current/past dates to observe populated response structure. Month value 1 = January. May want to test Language values 1, 2, 3 to identify language mappings. Future testing should include various date ranges and language combinations to fully document response schema and data availability windows."}
