{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters observed in request body or query string. This endpoint may rely on session cookies, headers (like Accept-Language), or user authentication context to determine which language data to load. The empty request body suggests language preference might be stored server-side or transmitted via other means.", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned with 200 OK status. This could indicate: (1) the endpoint sets language preference server-side without returning data, (2) the response was truly empty due to missing configuration, (3) language data is loaded asynchronously through another mechanism, or (4) the endpoint returns empty when no language change is needed. Expected response format appears to be JSON based on Content-Type header.", "documentation_notes": "This Infrastructure module endpoint appears to handle language/localization loading for the Sobranie (Parliament) website. The '/Infrastructure/' path prefix suggests this is a utility/system endpoint rather than data retrieval. The empty response with successful status indicates this may be a state-setting endpoint rather than data-returning. Common pattern: frontend calls this during initialization or language switching, server updates session/preference, then subsequent API calls return localized content. May need to examine cookies or session state changes to understand full behavior.", "other": "Context: sobranie.mk is the official website of the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia. The site likely supports multiple languages (Macedonian, Albanian, English). This endpoint is part of infrastructure layer suggesting architectural separation of concerns. To fully document: capture request headers (Accept-Language, Cookie), test with different language parameters if supported, observe cookie/session changes post-request, and correlate with subsequent requests to see localized responses. The empty response makes this endpoint's exact purpose ambiguous without additional context."}
