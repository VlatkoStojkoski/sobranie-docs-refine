{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. POST request with empty body to /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage endpoint. No query parameters, no request body content.","response_structure":"Returns HTTP 200 with application/json content-type but empty response body. The empty response suggests this may be a no-op endpoint, initialization call, or the language data is loaded server-side without client response.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language loading functionality. The empty response body despite 200 status is unusual - this could indicate: (1) language preferences are set via cookies/session rather than returned in response, (2) this is a legacy/deprecated endpoint, (3) the endpoint triggers server-side language initialization without client feedback, or (4) the actual language data is loaded through a different mechanism after this call. The endpoint is under /Infrastructure namespace suggesting it's part of the application's core initialization or configuration layer rather than data retrieval.","other":"Endpoint location suggests system-level functionality. The POST method with no body is atypical - typically POST endpoints either accept data or return data. This may be part of a session initialization sequence where the language selection is already determined by browser headers, cookies, or prior authentication. Consider testing with Accept-Language headers or checking if cookies are set in response headers. May need to examine full HAR for Set-Cookie headers or related sequential requests that follow this call."}
