{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "GetSittingDetails", "parameters": "SittingId (string, UUID format, required) - Identifier for parliamentary sitting session (example: 27bf274e-2c3e-45cd-8b53-bd39a7d58bb5); LanguageId (integer, required) - Language identifier for localization (1 likely represents Macedonian or primary language); MethodName (string, required) - RPC-style method name routing parameter", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned with HTTP 200 status. This may indicate: (1) no sitting details found for the provided SittingId, (2) an error condition handled silently, (3) the sitting exists but has no associated details, or (4) the response was captured mid-session or incompletely in the HAR file", "documentation_notes": "This endpoint uses an RPC/proxy pattern where all requests POST to /Routing/MakePostRequest and the actual method is specified via the MethodName parameter. GetSittingDetails appears designed to retrieve detailed information about a specific parliamentary sitting/session. The SittingId uses UUID format suggesting a database-backed system. The empty response in this capture is anomalous and may require testing with different SittingIds or session states to understand normal response structure. Related methods likely exist for listing sittings, creating sittings, or updating sitting information. The LanguageId parameter suggests the Sobranie API supports multilingual content, consistent with North Macedonia's multilingual parliamentary requirements.", "other": "The routing architecture is notable - using a single POST endpoint with method name discrimination rather than RESTful resource paths. This RPC-over-HTTP pattern is common in .NET applications using custom routing handlers. The endpoint name 'MakePostRequest' is generic and likely handles multiple methods beyond GetSittingDetails. To fully map this API, enumerate all possible MethodName values. The empty response warrants investigation: test with known-valid SittingIds from active sessions, verify authentication requirements, check if additional headers or session cookies are needed, or confirm if this sitting ID refers to a future/cancelled session with no details available yet."}
