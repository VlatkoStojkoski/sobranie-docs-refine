{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. POST request to /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage endpoint with no request body or query parameters.","response_structure":"Empty JSON response (status 200). The endpoint returns successfully but with no content in the response body.","documentation_notes":"This appears to be an infrastructure/utility endpoint for loading or initializing language settings. Despite being a POST request, it accepts no input parameters. The empty response suggests this may be a fire-and-forget operation that triggers server-side language configuration loading, possibly setting session state or initializing language resources without needing to return data to the client. The endpoint is part of the Infrastructure namespace/controller, indicating it's a system-level operation rather than business logic. May be called during application initialization or language switching operations.","other":"The empty response is unusual for a POST endpoint - typically POST requests return created resources or confirmation data. This could indicate: (1) the operation is purely side-effect based (session/cache initialization), (2) the response data is handled through other mechanisms (cookies, headers), or (3) this is a legacy endpoint. The Infrastructure namespace suggests this is part of the application's technical framework rather than domain-specific functionality. May be worth testing if this endpoint requires authentication or sets any cookies/headers that aren't visible in the sanitized data."}
