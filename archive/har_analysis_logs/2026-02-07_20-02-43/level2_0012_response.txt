{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "/GetQuestionDetails", "parameters": "LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization (e.g., 1 for Macedonian). QuestionId (string/UUID, required): Unique identifier for the parliamentary question in GUID format (e.g., '4899bb7e-11d6-49c4-86d0-87e4d05632ff')", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned with HTTP 200 status. This may indicate: (1) No question details found for the provided QuestionId, (2) Error condition returning empty response, (3) Question exists but has no additional details, or (4) Possible API malfunction. Expected structure unknown due to empty response.", "documentation_notes": "This endpoint uses a routing proxy pattern where the actual API method '/GetQuestionDetails' is passed as a parameter to the generic '/Routing/MakePostRequest' endpoint. This is an internal routing mechanism used by sobranie.mk (Macedonian Parliament website) to handle multiple API methods through a single entry point. The endpoint retrieves detailed information about parliamentary questions by their unique identifier. LanguageId=1 likely corresponds to Macedonian language. The empty response in this capture suggests either the question doesn't exist, has been deleted, or there was an error condition. Further investigation with valid QuestionIds is needed to determine the actual response structure.", "other": "API Pattern: Proxy/Router pattern with methodName routing. Base URL: https://www.sobranie.mk/Routing/MakePostRequest. This appears to be part of a broader API system where multiple methods are routed through a single endpoint. The QuestionId format follows standard GUID/UUID structure. Testing recommendations: Try with different valid QuestionIds to determine normal response structure, test different LanguageId values (likely 1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian, 3=English based on typical sobranie.mk multilingual support), examine whether this relates to Question Time/Parliamentary Questions feature.
