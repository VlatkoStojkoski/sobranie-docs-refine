{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"/GetAllQuestionStatuses","parameters":"LanguageId (integer, required) - Language identifier for localization, value 1 observed. Sent as JSON body to /Routing/MakePostRequest endpoint with methodName field specifying the actual API method to invoke.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with 200 status. Expected structure unknown - may return array of question status objects with fields like status_id, status_name, description when data exists, or this endpoint may be non-functional/deprecated.","documentation_notes":"This is a routing proxy pattern where /Routing/MakePostRequest acts as a dispatcher. The actual method /GetAllQuestionStatuses retrieves question statuses (likely for parliamentary questions/inquiries). Empty response suggests either no statuses exist for LanguageId=1, endpoint error, or missing authentication. Language parameter indicates multi-language support in the parliament system. Question statuses might include: submitted, pending, answered, rejected, withdrawn, etc.","other":"Sobranie.mk is the Assembly of North Macedonia parliament website. This routing architecture abstracts internal API methods behind a single POST endpoint. Similar methods likely exist: GetQuestionById, GetQuestionsByStatus, etc. The empty response is unusual - recommend testing with different LanguageId values (2 for Albanian, 3 for Turkish, etc.) or checking if authentication headers are required. This pattern may be used to obscure API structure or for legacy system integration."}
