{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllParliamentaryGroups","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetAllParliamentaryGroups' - specifies the API method to invoke; languageId (integer, required): 1 - language identifier for localization (1 likely represents Macedonian); StructureId (string, required): '5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473' - UUID format identifier, likely references a specific parliamentary structure or session","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with 200 status. This may indicate: (1) no parliamentary groups exist for the given StructureId, (2) authentication/authorization issue returning empty instead of error, (3) the endpoint experienced an error but returned 200 anyway, or (4) data exists but serialization failed","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a dispatcher to multiple backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. This pattern suggests an RPC-style API design rather than RESTful architecture. The method GetAllParliamentaryGroups is intended to retrieve all parliamentary groups (political parties/factions) for a given parliamentary structure. The empty response with 200 status is unusual and suggests either no data exists, an error condition, or incorrect parameter values. StructureId appears to be a key filtering parameter that may need to match active parliamentary sessions.","other":"API Pattern: RPC-style POST dispatcher; Base URL: https://www.sobranie.mk/Routing/MakePostRequest; Domain: sobranie.mk (Assembly/Parliament of North Macedonia); Testing Notes: Try different StructureId values to find active sessions, test with languageId 2 for Albanian or other language variants, investigate if authentication headers are required; Related Methods: Likely other methods exist following pattern 'GetAll*', 'Get*ById', etc. that can be invoked through same endpoint; Error Handling: Returns 200 even when no data available - check for application-level error codes in non-empty responses"}
