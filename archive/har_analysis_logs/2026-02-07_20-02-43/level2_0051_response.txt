{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. POST request with empty body. No query string parameters. No authentication tokens observed in sanitized request.","response_structure":"Empty response body. Status 200 indicates successful completion. Content-Type is application/json but actual payload is empty (null or empty object/array).","documentation_notes":"This endpoint appears to be part of the Infrastructure namespace/module for the Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie) website. The method name 'LoadLanguage' suggests it handles language/localization loading, possibly initializing language settings or resources. Despite the name implying data retrieval, the empty response may indicate: (1) language preferences are set via cookies/session rather than returned in response, (2) the endpoint triggers server-side state changes only, (3) the actual language data is cached client-side and this validates/refreshes it, or (4) this is a no-op call in certain contexts. The POST method usage (rather than GET) suggests this may modify server state or user session preferences.","other":"Path structure follows pattern /Infrastructure/[Action]. This suggests a controller-action routing pattern common in ASP.NET MVC or similar frameworks. The empty response with success status is unusual for a 'Load' operation and may warrant further investigation with non-sanitized requests to determine if response varies based on session state, cookies, or authentication context. Recommend testing with different language parameters or headers to fully document behavior."}
