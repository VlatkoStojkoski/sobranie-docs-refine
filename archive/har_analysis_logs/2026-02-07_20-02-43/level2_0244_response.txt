{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "/GetMPsClubDetails", "parameters": "mpsClubId (string, UUID format, required) - Unique identifier for the parliamentary club/group; LanguageId (integer, required) - Language selection (1 appears to be default, likely Macedonian)", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned in this capture. Expected structure unknown - likely returns details about a parliamentary club/group including name, members, leadership, establishment date, and other metadata when valid data exists.", "documentation_notes": "This is a routing proxy endpoint pattern where the actual API method is specified via the 'methodName' parameter in the POST body rather than the URL path. The base endpoint /Routing/MakePostRequest acts as a gateway that routes to internal methods. The method /GetMPsClubDetails retrieves information about parliamentary clubs/groups (political party groups in parliament). The mpsClubId uses UUID format suggesting a structured database backend. Empty response may indicate: invalid club ID, club no longer exists, or data access issue. This appears to be part of the Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie) public API for accessing parliamentary data.", "other": "Part of sobranie.mk (Macedonian Parliament) website API. Uses non-RESTful routing pattern with method name in request body. The 'MPs Club' terminology refers to parliamentary groups/caucuses formed by political parties. Similar endpoints likely exist for individual MPs, sessions, votes, and legislation. The LanguageId parameter suggests multi-language support (Macedonian, Albanian, English likely options). Consider testing with different valid club IDs and language values to map full response structure."}
