{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllInstitutionsForFilter","parameters":"methodName (string, required): The RPC-style method to invoke, value 'GetAllInstitutionsForFilter'. languageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization, value 1 likely represents Macedonian or default language.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned. Expected structure unknown - may return array of institution objects with fields like id, name, type, or may return empty array when no institutions exist. Actual structure needs verification with non-empty response.","documentation_notes":"This is an RPC-style endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a generic routing handler for multiple methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. This particular method 'GetAllInstitutionsForFilter' appears designed to retrieve a list of institutions for filtering purposes, likely used in dropdown menus or filter interfaces on the sobranie.mk (Macedonian Parliament) website. The empty response suggests either no data exists, an error occurred silently, or the method returns empty when no filters are applied. The languageId parameter indicates multi-language support.","other":"Domain sobranie.mk is the Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia. This generic routing pattern suggests a custom API architecture rather than REST. Multiple similar methods likely exist using the same endpoint with different methodName values. The institution data might include parliamentary bodies, committees, or related governmental organizations. Investigation needed: test with different languageId values (2, 3, etc.), check if additional filter parameters can be passed, verify response when data exists, identify other available methodName values."}
