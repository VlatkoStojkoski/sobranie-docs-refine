{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value: 1), 'Month' (integer, value: 1 for January), 'Year' (integer, value: 2026). No query parameters. Content-Type: application/json.","response_structure":"Empty response body with 200 OK status. Expected structure unknown - may return calendar events array when data exists, or empty when no events scheduled for the specified month/year.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint for retrieving custom calendar events from North Macedonia's Parliament (Sobranie). Located under /Moldova/ path (likely legacy naming). Language parameter 1 likely represents Macedonian language. The empty response for January 2026 suggests either no events are scheduled that far in advance, or the service only returns data for past/current periods. This is a calendar/scheduling service that appears to support multi-language retrieval of parliamentary events.","other":"Service path indicates legacy ASP.NET Web Services (ASMX) architecture. The /Moldova/ directory path is unusual for sobranie.mk (North Macedonia's parliament) and may indicate legacy naming from historical periods or shared codebase. Future requests should test with current/past dates to understand actual response structure, test Language parameter values (likely 1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian based on official languages), and verify month boundaries (1-12)."}
