{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetSittingDetails","parameters":"SittingId (string/GUID) - Unique identifier for a parliamentary sitting session; LanguageId (integer) - Language selector (1 appears to be default, likely Macedonian)","response_structure":"Empty response returned in this instance. Expected structure unknown - may return sitting details including date, time, agenda items, participants, voting records, or session metadata when valid SittingId is provided. Response likely JSON object or array.","documentation_notes":"This is a proxy/router endpoint pattern where actual method name is passed in request body. The URL path /Routing/MakePostRequest acts as a generic dispatcher. Multiple API methods likely accessible through this single endpoint by varying MethodName parameter. GUID format for SittingId suggests database-backed system. Empty response may indicate: invalid/expired sitting ID, sitting not yet published, access restrictions, or actual empty sitting record.","other":"API uses POST for what appears to be read operations (GetSittingDetails), which is non-RESTful but common for complex parameter passing. The routing pattern suggests internal API not designed for public consumption. GUID indicates modern backend (likely .NET/C# based on MakePostRequest naming convention). LanguageId parameter indicates multilingual support. No authentication tokens visible in this request - may be session-based or publicly accessible endpoints. Consider testing with known valid SittingId values and different LanguageId values (2, 3 for other languages)."}
