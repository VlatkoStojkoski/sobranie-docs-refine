{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. POST request to /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage with no query string parameters and no request body.","response_structure":"Returns HTTP 200 with application/json Content-Type. Response body is empty (zero bytes or empty JSON object). Expected structure: likely {} or null, but actual implementation returns empty response.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for loading language resources or settings. The endpoint name suggests it handles language/localization loading, possibly for initializing language preferences or fetching translation resources. Despite being a POST request, it accepts no input parameters. The empty response indicates this may be a fire-and-forget operation that triggers server-side language initialization, sets session state, or the language data is stored elsewhere (cookies, session). This could be called during application bootstrap or language switching operations. The empty response suggests the actual language data might be cached client-side or returned through other mechanisms.","other":"Endpoint category: Infrastructure/System. Authentication requirements unknown from this capture. No error codes observed. The POST method choice (instead of GET) suggests it may have side effects like session state modification or cache warming. Consider checking response headers for Set-Cookie or other session-related headers. May need to test with different Accept-Language headers or session contexts to understand full behavior. Related endpoints to investigate: language selection, translation fetching, locale settings."}
