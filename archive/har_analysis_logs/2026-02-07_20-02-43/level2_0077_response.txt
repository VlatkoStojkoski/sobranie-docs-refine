{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. POST request with empty body. No query string parameters. No apparent authentication or session tokens in sanitized data.","response_structure":"Empty JSON response (status 200). Response body is empty, suggesting this may be a state-changing operation or initialization endpoint that returns minimal data.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language loading functionality. Part of the /Infrastructure namespace, suggesting core system functionality. The empty response with 200 status indicates successful execution but no data return - possibly sets session/cookie state server-side or triggers a backend process. May be called during application initialization or language switching. The endpoint accepts POST despite no body content, which is unusual and suggests it may rely on session context, cookies, or headers (Authorization, Accept-Language, etc.) not visible in sanitized data.","other":"Endpoint pattern suggests ASP.NET MVC or similar framework structure (Controller/Action naming). The empty request/response pair makes this difficult to reverse-engineer without observing actual usage with different inputs or examining response headers. May be part of internationalization (i18n) infrastructure. Consider testing with Accept-Language headers, language codes in cookies, or examining Set-Cookie headers in actual responses. This could be a legacy endpoint or one that's been deprecated but still returns 200 for compatibility."}
