{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - The API method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier (1 = presumably Macedonian or default language); Month (integer, required): Month number (1-12) for which to retrieve agenda; Year (integer, required): Year for which to retrieve agenda (e.g., 2026)","response_structure":"Empty response body in this capture. Expected structure unknown but likely returns an array or object containing monthly agenda items/events for the Sobranie (Assembly) for the specified month and year. May include session dates,議題 items, or parliamentary activities.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that dispatches to different methods based on the 'methodName' parameter. The URL pattern '/Routing/MakePostRequest' suggests a centralized POST handler that routes to various backend methods. The request for January 2026 returned empty, possibly indicating no scheduled agenda for that future date, or the month/year combination has no data yet. The LanguageId parameter suggests multilingual support in the Sobranie website. This endpoint appears to be part of the Macedonian Parliament's public website API for retrieving parliamentary schedules and agendas.","other":"The empty response for a future date (January 2026) is notable - this could mean: (1) no agenda scheduled yet for that period, (2) the API only returns data for past/current periods, or (3) data is not yet populated. Testing with current/past dates would reveal actual response structure. The routing pattern suggests other methods may be callable through this same endpoint by changing the 'methodName' parameter. This is a method-based RPC-style API rather than RESTful resource-based design."}
