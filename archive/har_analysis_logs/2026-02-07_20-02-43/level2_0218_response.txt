{"route_type": "POST /Routing/MakePostRequest", "method_name": "GetAllStructuresForFilter", "parameters": "methodName: string (value='GetAllStructuresForFilter'), languageId: integer (1 for Macedonian language, likely supports multiple language IDs for internationalization)", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned (status 200). This could indicate: no structures exist, structures filtered out, error condition silently handled, or method requires additional parameters not provided in this request.", "documentation_notes": "This is a generic routing endpoint that dispatches to backend methods based on the methodName parameter. The GetAllStructuresForFilter method appears designed to retrieve organizational or governmental structures with filtering capabilities. The empty response suggests either no data matches the implicit filter criteria, or required filter parameters were omitted. The languageId parameter indicates multi-language support in the Sobranie (Parliament of North Macedonia) system. Similar requests may require additional filter parameters like structure type, date ranges, or status flags.", "other": "The /Routing/MakePostRequest endpoint acts as a centralized API gateway/dispatcher pattern. This architectural pattern suggests multiple method_name values exist for different operations. To discover the full API surface, enumerate other possible methodName values. The empty response with 200 status is noteworthy - proper API design would typically return an empty array [] for no results rather than empty body. Consider testing with additional parameters like structureTypeId, dateFrom, dateTo, statusId, or pagination parameters (page, pageSize). The sobranie.mk domain confirms this is the official Parliamentary website of North Macedonia."}
