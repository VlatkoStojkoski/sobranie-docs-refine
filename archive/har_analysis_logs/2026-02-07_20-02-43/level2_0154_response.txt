{"route_type": "Static HTML Template", "method_name": "GET /Scripts/Moldova/agenda-item-votings/agenda-item-votings.html", "parameters": "None - This is a GET request with no query parameters, path parameters, or request body. The URL suggests this may be a template file that could be used with dynamic parameters in a client-side application context.", "response_structure": "Empty HTML response (0 bytes). Status 200 OK with text/html Content-Type. Despite successful status, the response body is empty, suggesting this could be: (1) A template file that gets populated client-side via JavaScript, (2) A partial HTML fragment used in AJAX/dynamic loading, (3) A file that failed to load properly despite 200 status, or (4) A placeholder endpoint.", "documentation_notes": "This endpoint appears to be part of the North Macedonia Parliament (sobranie.mk) website's voting system interface. The path structure '/Scripts/Moldova/agenda-item-votings/' suggests this is a component for displaying voting information on agenda items. The 'Moldova' directory name is interesting - could indicate code/template reuse from another parliamentary system or a vendor name. The file serves an empty HTML response, which is unusual but indicates it's likely a client-side template that gets populated dynamically through JavaScript or another mechanism. This would typically be loaded as part of a larger page structure or used in an SPA (Single Page Application) architecture. To understand the full functionality, one would need to examine: (1) The JavaScript files that reference this template, (2) Any AJAX calls that populate this template with data, (3) The parent pages that include this template.", "other": "Security/Architecture observations: The path contains 'Scripts' which might indicate legacy ASP.NET structure or simply organizational naming. The empty response with 200 status is technically valid but unusual - most modern APIs would return structured data or meaningful HTML. This suggests the actual data fetching happens through separate API endpoints that populate this template. For complete API discovery, should investigate: (1) Network requests made after this template loads, (2) Associated JavaScript bundles, (3) Potential API endpoints matching pattern like '/api/agenda-item-votings' or similar RESTful structures. The template name suggests it handles displaying multiple votings for agenda items, implying a one-to-many relationship structure in the data model."}
