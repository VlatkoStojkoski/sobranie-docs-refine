{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: Language (integer, value 1 observed), Month (integer, range 1-12, value 10 observed for October), Year (integer, value 2025 observed). Language parameter likely: 1=Macedonian or primary language. No query parameters. Content-Type: application/json required.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (status 200). Expected structure unknown - may return array of calendar events when data exists, or empty response indicates no events for specified month/year. Likely returns JSON array of event objects with fields such as date, title, description, event type when events exist.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services). Calendar service for retrieving custom events. Path structure: /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx/GetCustomEventsCalendar suggests this is Moldovan parliament calendar system. Empty response could indicate: no events scheduled for October 2025, or end of available data range. Service accepts future dates (2025). Language parameter suggests multi-language support. Month/Year combination allows calendar navigation.","other":"Host: www.sobranie.mk (Macedonian Parliament website). ASMX technology indicates legacy .NET framework service. Service path includes 'Moldova' which may indicate section for Moldovan-related content or historical naming. The empty response prevents full schema documentation - would need to test with known populated months (current/past dates) to document complete event object structure. Recommend testing with current month/year and Language values 1,2,etc to map language codes and retrieve actual event schema."}
