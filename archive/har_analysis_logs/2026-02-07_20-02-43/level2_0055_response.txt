{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. The POST method is used but no data is transmitted. Language selection may be handled via session cookies, headers (Accept-Language), or other implicit mechanisms not visible in the request body.","response_structure":"Empty response body with 200 OK status. The endpoint returns no JSON data despite Content-Type being application/json. This suggests the operation may be setting server-side session state or cookies rather than returning data to the client.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure utility endpoint for language loading/switching functionality. Located under /Infrastructure namespace suggesting it's a system-level operation rather than domain-specific API. The empty response indicates this is likely a state-setting operation (e.g., setting language preference in session) rather than a data retrieval endpoint. The POST method combined with no parameters suggests the language selection might be determined by: 1) Browser Accept-Language headers, 2) Existing session/cookie data, 3) User authentication context, or 4) Default system language. Success is indicated by 200 status rather than response payload.","other":"Endpoint naming follows PascalCase convention. Part of sobranie.mk (North Macedonian Parliament) website infrastructure. The empty response with explicit application/json Content-Type is unusual - typically would expect at least a success indicator like {\"success\":true} or status message. This could indicate: incomplete API implementation, legacy endpoint, or intentional design where success/failure is communicated solely via HTTP status codes. May warrant testing with different Accept-Language headers or authentication states to understand full behavior."}
