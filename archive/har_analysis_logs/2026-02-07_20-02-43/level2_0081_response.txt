{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetSittingDetails","parameters":"SittingId (UUID/GUID format, required) - Identifier for a specific parliamentary sitting session (e.g., 'd0bc2eb4-e374-4241-b7d6-6a4d85c4c5af'); LanguageId (integer, required) - Language selector where 1 likely represents Macedonian (other values may be 2 for Albanian or other supported languages)","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (Status 200). This could indicate: (1) No sitting details found for the provided SittingId, (2) The sitting exists but has no associated details yet, (3) API error returning empty instead of proper error response, or (4) The sitting data exists but wasn't returned due to processing issue. Expected structure when data exists would likely include: sitting date/time, agenda items, attendees, voting records, transcripts, and related documents.","documentation_notes":"This endpoint retrieves detailed information about a specific parliamentary sitting session. The sobranie.mk site uses a generic routing pattern (/Routing/MakePostRequest) where the actual method is specified in the request body via 'MethodName' parameter. This is an RPC-style API pattern rather than RESTful. The endpoint appears to be part of the Macedonian Parliament's public information system. The UUID format for SittingId suggests a database-backed system. Empty response may require investigation - could be invalid ID, permissions issue, or the sitting simply has no details populated yet.","other":"API Pattern: RPC-style with method routing through request body rather than URL paths. Base URL: https://www.sobranie.mk/Routing/MakePostRequest. Content-Type: application/json for both request and response. The generic routing endpoint suggests multiple methods are available through the same URL by changing MethodName. Related methods likely include: GetSittings (list), GetSittingAgenda, GetSittingVotes, etc. The LanguageId parameter indicates multi-language support which is consistent with North Macedonia's bilingual (Macedonian/Albanian) official language policy. Further testing needed with valid SittingId values to document full response structure."}
