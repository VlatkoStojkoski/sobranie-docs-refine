{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllStructuresForFilter","parameters":"methodName (string, required): The backend method to invoke, value 'GetAllStructuresForFilter'. languageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization, value 1 observed (likely Macedonian). No URL parameters. Body must be JSON with these two fields.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with HTTP 200 status. Expected structure unknown - may return array of structure objects for filtering purposes when data exists, or this endpoint may be deprecated/non-functional. Response Content-Type is application/json despite empty body.","documentation_notes":"This is a routing/proxy endpoint pattern where the actual method name is passed as a parameter rather than being part of the URL path. The MakePostRequest endpoint acts as a dispatcher to backend methods. GetAllStructuresForFilter suggests retrieval of organizational/parliamentary structures for filtering UI elements. The empty response indicates either: (1) no structures exist, (2) authorization/session required, (3) endpoint is non-functional, or (4) additional parameters needed. Language ID 1 appears to be Macedonian based on sobranie.mk domain (Macedonian Parliament).","other":"Routing pattern suggests a generic RPC-style API design. Multiple other methods likely accessible through same /Routing/MakePostRequest endpoint with different methodName values. Consider testing with authentication headers/cookies if available. This filter endpoint likely supports a search or browse feature on the parliament website. May be part of a larger API for accessing parliamentary data, documents, or organizational information."}
