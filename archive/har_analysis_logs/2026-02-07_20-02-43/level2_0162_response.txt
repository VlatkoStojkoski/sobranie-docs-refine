{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetParliamentMPsNoImage","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetParliamentMPsNoImage' - Specifies the backend method to invoke. languageId (integer, required): Language identifier (1 observed, likely Macedonian). genderId (integer, nullable): Filter by gender (null = no filter). ageFrom (integer, nullable): Minimum age filter. ageTo (integer, nullable): Maximum age filter. politicalPartyId (string/integer, nullable): Filter by political party. searchText (string, nullable): Text search across MP names/data. page (integer, required): Pagination page number (1-indexed). rows (integer, required): Results per page (12 observed). StructureId (string UUID, required): '5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473' - Likely identifies the Parliament/legislative structure. coalition (string, optional): Filter by coalition membership (empty string observed). constituency (string, optional): Filter by electoral constituency (empty string observed).","response_structure":"Empty response body received in this capture. Expected response would likely be JSON containing: array of MP objects without images, pagination metadata (total records, total pages), each MP record containing: name, political party, constituency, age/birthdate, gender, position/role, mandate period, contact information, biography text. The 'NoImage' suffix suggests image URLs/binary data are excluded from response payload for performance.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that dispatches to backend methods via methodName parameter. The '/Routing/MakePostRequest' path acts as a gateway/proxy pattern. GetParliamentMPsNoImage retrieves Member of Parliament listings without image data, supporting multiple filter dimensions (gender, age range, party, constituency, coalition) and text search. Pagination is implemented with page/rows parameters. The StructureId UUID appears to be a constant for the current parliamentary session/structure. Empty response suggests either: no MPs match the criteria, an error occurred, or response capture failed. Language support indicates multilingual content (languageId=1 likely Macedonian, possibly 2=Albanian given North Macedonia's official languages). This endpoint is optimized for list views where images aren't needed, likely paired with a 'GetParliamentMPs' variant that includes images.","other":"API follows a command pattern where all operations POST to single routing endpoint with methodName discriminator. This architectural choice centralizes routing logic server-side rather than using RESTful resource paths. Other potential methodName values to investigate: GetParliamentMPs (with images), GetParliamentMPDetails, GetPoliticalParties, GetConstituencies, GetCoalitions. The UUID format for StructureId suggests multi-tenant or multi-session architecture. Coalition and constituency as separate parameters indicate these are distinct filtering dimensions in North Macedonia's parliamentary system. Age filtering (ageFrom/ageTo) is unusual for MP listings, suggesting analytics or demographic research capabilities. Empty strings vs null values appear semantically different (empty=no filter vs null=not applicable). Security consideration: no authentication tokens visible, suggesting public API or session-based auth via cookies."}
