{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the backend method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): 1 for primary language, likely Macedonian (mk) or other supported language identifier; Month (integer, required): month number 1-12, value 1 = January; Year (integer, required): four-digit year, example shows 2026 indicating future date support","response_structure":"Empty response body returned in this capture. Expected structure likely JSON array or object containing agenda/calendar items for the specified month and year. Possible fields might include date, time, event title, session type, description, or links to detailed session information. Empty response may indicate no scheduled events for January 2026 or data not yet available for future dates.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that acts as a dispatcher for multiple backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the POST body. This pattern suggests the Sobranie.mk (North Macedonia Parliament) website uses a unified API gateway approach where /Routing/MakePostRequest serves as the single entry point for various data retrieval operations. The GetMonthlyAgenda method specifically retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar data for a given month and year with language localization support.","other":"The empty response for January 2026 suggests this API allows querying future dates but may not have data populated that far ahead. Testing with current or past dates would reveal typical response structure. The LanguageId parameter indicates multilingual support, common for official government websites. Other methods likely accessible through this same routing endpoint include session details,议员 information, legislation tracking, and voting records. Consider testing with Month values 1-12 and recent Year values to map out available historical data range."}
