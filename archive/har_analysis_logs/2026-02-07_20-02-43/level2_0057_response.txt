{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the backend method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): 1 for primary language (likely Macedonian), presumably supports multiple languages; Month (integer, required): 1-12 representing calendar month; Year (integer, required): four-digit year (2026 in example)","response_structure":"Empty response returned for the test query (January 2026). Expected structure likely contains array of agenda items/events with fields such as date, title, description, session type, participants. Empty result suggests no scheduled events for future date or endpoint requires valid current/past dates only.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that acts as RPC-style dispatcher. The /Routing/MakePostRequest path accepts different methodName values to call various backend methods. This particular method retrieves parliamentary monthly agenda/calendar. The empty response for future date (2026) suggests data only exists for current/past periods, or the parliament hasn't scheduled that far ahead. To discover actual response structure, test with current or recent past dates. Language support indicates multilingual API capability. Similar methodName pattern likely exists for other parliamentary data (sessions, votes, members, etc).","other":"Sobranie.mk is the Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia official website. This RPC-style architecture suggests a unified API gateway pattern rather than RESTful design. The methodName parameter is key for API discovery - other likely methods include GetSessionDetails, GetMemberInfo, GetVotingRecords, etc. Consider testing Month values 1-12 and recent Years (2023-2025) to get populated responses. The LanguageId likely supports Macedonian (1), Albanian (2), and English (3) based on North Macedonia's official languages. Empty response could also indicate authentication requirement for future data or rate limiting."}
