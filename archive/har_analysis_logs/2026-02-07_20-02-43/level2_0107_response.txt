{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): The API method to invoke, value 'GetMonthlyAgenda'. LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier, value 1 observed (likely Macedonian). Month (integer, required): Month number 1-12, value 1 tested. Year (integer, required): Four-digit year, value 2026 tested.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned for the tested parameters (January 2026). Expected structure unknown but likely returns agenda/calendar data when events exist. Probable JSON array or object containing parliamentary session information, meetings, or scheduled activities for the specified month and year.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that dispatches to different backend methods based on the methodName parameter. The GetMonthlyAgenda method retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar information for a specific month and year. The empty response for January 2026 suggests either no scheduled events exist for that future date, or the system only returns data for past/current periods. LanguageId=1 likely corresponds to Macedonian language. This follows a RPC-style pattern where a single POST endpoint routes to multiple backend methods rather than RESTful resource-based routing.","other":"The response was empty which could indicate: (1) No agenda items scheduled for January 2026, (2) Future dates return no data, (3) Invalid parameter combination, or (4) Data not yet available. Testing with current/past dates would reveal actual response structure. The sobranie.mk domain indicates this is the Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia. Consider testing with LanguageId values 2, 3 for other languages (likely Albanian, English). Month/Year validation boundaries unknown - test edge cases like Month=0, Month=13, or historical years."}
