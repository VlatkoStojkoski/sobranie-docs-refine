{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllSittings","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetAllSittings' - specifies the remote method to invoke; Page (integer, required): pagination page number, starts at 1; Rows (integer, required): number of rows per page, set to 10 in example; LanguageId (integer, required): language selector, 1 appears to be default/Macedonian; TypeId (integer, required): sitting type filter, value 1 used; CommitteeId (string/null, optional): filter by committee identifier; StatusId (integer/null, optional): filter by sitting status; DateFrom (string/null, optional): start date filter in ISO 8601 format; DateTo (string, optional): end date filter in ISO 8601 format, example '2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z'; SessionId (integer/null, optional): filter by parliamentary session; Number (integer/null, optional): filter by sitting number; StructureId (string, required): UUID identifying organizational structure '5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473'","response_structure":"Empty response returned in this capture. Expected structure likely contains array of sitting objects with details about parliamentary sessions including dates, type, committee, status, session info, and sitting numbers. Response format presumably JSON array or object with pagination metadata (total records, pages) and data array.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic RPC-style POST endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that dispatches to different backend methods based on the 'methodName' parameter. GetAllSittings retrieves parliamentary sitting/session information with extensive filtering capabilities. The endpoint uses pagination (Page/Rows). Date filtering supports range queries with DateFrom/DateTo in ISO format. StructureId appears to be a constant UUID possibly representing the Macedonian Parliament structure. Empty response may indicate no sittings matched the criteria (future date filter to 2025-12-01) or an error condition. TypeId=1 may represent plenary sittings vs committee meetings.","other":"This is part of the sobranie.mk (Macedonian Parliament) API. The routing pattern suggests a generic dispatcher endpoint rather than RESTful design. Multiple method names likely supported beyond GetAllSittings. The StructureId UUID (5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473) should be documented as it appears required. Future date in DateTo (2025-12-01) combined with empty response suggests the query found no matching records or the filter logic may be inverted. Status code 200 with empty body is unusual - typical pagination responses include metadata even with zero results. Investigation needed to determine if empty response indicates error vs no-data condition."}
