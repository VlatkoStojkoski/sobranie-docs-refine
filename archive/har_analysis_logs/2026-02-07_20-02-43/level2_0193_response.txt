{"route_type": "GET", "method_name": "getQuestionDetailsTemplate", "parameters": "None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. It returns a static HTML template file.", "response_structure": "HTML template file (empty in this capture). Expected to be an AngularJS or client-side template used for rendering question details in the Moldova module. The file path suggests this is a view template rather than a data endpoint.", "documentation_notes": "This is NOT a data API endpoint but rather a static HTML template resource. Located in /Scripts/Moldova/questions/details/ directory structure, indicating it's part of the Moldova parliamentary questions module. The template is likely loaded by a JavaScript framework (probably AngularJS given the file structure) to render question detail views on the client side. The empty response body in this capture could indicate the template hasn't been created yet, was deleted, or there was an error serving it. This is a front-end asset, not a backend API route.", "other": "File extension is .html indicating a template file. The path structure /Scripts/Moldova/questions/details/ suggests a modular frontend architecture. This appears to be part of a larger single-page application (SPA) framework. Not useful for API discovery as it's a UI template, not a data endpoint. To find actual API endpoints for question details, look for XHR/fetch requests to paths like /api/questions/, /data/questions/, or similar JSON-returning endpoints."}
