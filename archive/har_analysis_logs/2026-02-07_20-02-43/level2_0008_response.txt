{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"/GetAllQuestions","parameters":"LanguageId (integer, required): Language selector (1 likely default/Macedonian). CurrentPage (integer): Current page number for pagination. Page (integer): Page number (appears redundant with CurrentPage). Rows (integer): Results per page (15 default). SearchText (string): Free text search filter. RegistrationNumber (string): Filter by question registration number. StatusId (integer, nullable): Filter by question status. From (string): Origin/source filter (empty in sample). To (string): Destination/target filter (empty in sample). CommitteeId (integer, nullable): Filter by parliamentary committee. DateFrom (date, nullable): Start date for date range filter. DateTo (date, nullable): End date for date range filter. StructureId (string, GUID format): Structure/organizational unit identifier (5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473 in sample).","response_structure":"Empty response body in this capture. Expected structure likely includes: array of parliamentary questions with fields such as question ID, registration number, text/content, submitter information, date submitted, status, assigned committee, language, and possibly response/answer data. Pagination metadata expected (total count, pages, current page).","documentation_notes":"This is a proxy/routing endpoint pattern where the actual API method is specified in the request body via 'methodName' field rather than the URL path. The /Routing/MakePostRequest acts as a generic POST handler that routes to the actual method /GetAllQuestions. This retrieves parliamentary questions with extensive filtering capabilities including text search, date ranges, committee assignment, status, and registration numbers. The empty response suggests either no questions matched the filters (unlikely with default parameters) or a capture/timing issue. The StructureId GUID appears mandatory and likely corresponds to the current parliamentary session or term. Dual page parameters (CurrentPage and Page) suggest possible legacy API evolution.","other":"Architectural pattern: Generic routing proxy endpoint. The sobranie.mk site uses a centralized POST routing mechanism instead of RESTful URL patterns. All POST requests go through /Routing/MakePostRequest with methodName in payload. This is unusual for modern APIs but allows centralized request handling. The StructureId GUID (5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473) should be investigated as it likely represents the current legislative period/assembly structure and may change between sessions. Empty response body warrants further investigation - may indicate error condition, no results, or incomplete HAR capture. Related endpoints to discover: GetQuestionById, GetQuestionStatuses, GetCommittees, GetStructures."}
