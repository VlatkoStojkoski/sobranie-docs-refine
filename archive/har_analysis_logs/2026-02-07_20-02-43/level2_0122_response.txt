{"route_type":"GET","method_name":"get_sitting_html_page","parameters":"None - static HTML page request with no query parameters or request body","response_structure":"HTML page (text/html) - Response body is empty in this capture, likely due to sanitization or the page being truly empty. Expected structure would be an HTML document containing sitting/session information based on the URL path context.","documentation_notes":"This endpoint serves a static HTML page related to parliamentary sittings under the Moldova scripts directory. The path structure '/Scripts/Moldova/sitting/sitting.html' suggests this may be part of a Moldova-specific module or historical section of the parliament website. The empty response in this capture may indicate: (1) the page no longer exists or has been moved, (2) the content was sanitized during HAR capture, (3) the page requires authentication/session that wasn't present, or (4) the page dynamically loads content via JavaScript. This appears to be a legacy endpoint given the 'Scripts' directory naming convention and may not be actively maintained. Not a RESTful API endpoint but rather a traditional web page resource.","other":"Content-Type is text/html indicating this is a web page endpoint, not a JSON API. The 'Moldova' reference in the path is interesting as this is the Parliament of North Macedonia (sobranie.mk), suggesting possible historical content or international parliamentary cooperation materials. The empty response with 200 status is unusual - typically would expect either content or a 404/410 status. May warrant further investigation with browser developer tools to see if content loads dynamically. URL pattern suggests there may be related endpoints at /Scripts/Moldova/sitting/ with different HTML files or subdirectories."}
