{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value 1 observed), 'Month' (integer, range 1-12, value 1 observed for January), 'Year' (integer, value 2026 observed). All three fields appear required for calendar event retrieval.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (status 200). Expected structure unknown - may return array of calendar events with date, title, description fields when events exist, or genuinely empty for periods without events. Content-Type is application/json.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET) for retrieving custom calendar events from North Macedonia Parliament (sobranie.mk). Path '/Moldova/services/' suggests multi-country/region implementation. Language parameter likely controls localization (1 may represent Macedonian or English). Empty response for January 2026 suggests either no events scheduled or future date limitation. Service follows ASMX convention with .asmx extension and method name in path.","other":"Service is under '/Moldova/' path which is geographically inconsistent with sobranie.mk (North Macedonia Parliament) - possible legacy naming, shared codebase, or regional parliamentary cooperation system. Year 2026 is future date at time of typical analysis, suggesting forward-looking calendar functionality. Standard ASMX SOAP-to-JSON bridge pattern. May require authentication or session for certain date ranges. Consider testing with current/past dates and different Language values (0, 2, etc.) to determine response structure."}
