{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters in URL query string or request body. Method accepts POST request with no visible payload. May rely on session cookies, authentication headers, or server-side context (like current user language preference stored in session) to determine which language data to load.", "response_structure": "Empty JSON response (status 200). This suggests either: (1) the endpoint sets language preference server-side without returning data, (2) the response is consumed for side effects only (session update), (3) language data is cached/stored elsewhere and this is a trigger endpoint, or (4) the actual language data might be delivered through cookies or headers rather than response body.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language management. Located under /Infrastructure/ path prefix suggesting internal/system-level functionality. The empty response with 200 OK indicates successful processing but no content returned. This is likely a configuration or preference-setting endpoint rather than a data retrieval endpoint. The method name 'LoadLanguage' is somewhat ambiguous - could mean 'load language preference' (set) or 'load language data' (get), but POST method and empty response suggest it's for setting/initializing language state. Part of the sobranie.mk (Assembly of North Macedonia) website infrastructure for multi-language support.", "other": "Endpoint behavior suggests this might be called during page initialization or language switching. The empty response pattern is unusual for a 'Load' operation - typically would expect language strings, locale data, or confirmation message. Consider checking: (1) Response headers for Set-Cookie or custom headers containing language data, (2) Whether subsequent requests show language changes, (3) Browser network timing to see if this triggers additional resource loads. This endpoint may work in conjunction with other language-related endpoints or rely on client-side language packs that are already loaded."}
