{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the remote method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): 1 for one language option, likely Macedonian=1, possibly Albanian or English as alternatives; Month (integer, required): 1-12 representing calendar month, validated example shows 1 for January; Year (integer, required): four-digit year, validated example shows 2026 indicating future date support","response_structure":"Empty response received in test case. Expected structure unknown but likely returns array or object containing agenda/calendar items for the specified month and year. Possible fields might include: date, event title, event type, session info, parliamentary activities. Response format appears to be JSON based on Content-Type header.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic RPC-style routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a proxy to backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar for a specific month and year. Empty response may indicate: no scheduled events for January 2026, future date with no data yet, or error condition not reflected in HTTP status. The endpoint pattern suggests other methods exist using the same routing mechanism. Language support indicates multilingual parliament website (North Macedonia has Macedonian and Albanian as official languages).","other":"Endpoint follows RPC pattern rather than RESTful design. All requests go through single /Routing/MakePostRequest URL with method differentiation via body parameter. This is common in legacy or .NET WebForms/MVC applications. The .mk TLD confirms North Macedonia parliament. Testing with past dates and current dates recommended to verify response structure. Other potential method names to discover: GetDailyAgenda, GetSessionDetails, GetMPList, etc. The empty response for a future date (2026) suggests the system may not have data populated that far ahead, or validation prevents future date queries."}
