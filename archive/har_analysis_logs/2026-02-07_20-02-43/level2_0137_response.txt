{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters observed in this request. The endpoint accepts POST requests with no query parameters and no request body. This suggests it may rely on session cookies, headers (such as Accept-Language), or server-side session state to determine which language to load.", "response_structure": "Empty response body with 200 OK status. This indicates the endpoint either: (1) sets language preferences server-side via cookies/session without returning data, (2) returns an empty result when no language change is needed, or (3) may return language data under different conditions not captured in this request.", "documentation_notes": "This appears to be a language/localization management endpoint under the Infrastructure namespace. The endpoint name 'LoadLanguage' suggests it handles language preference loading or switching for the parliamentary website. The POST method indicates this may modify server-side state (setting language preference) rather than just retrieving data. The empty response suggests this is likely a state-changing operation that doesn't return confirmation data, possibly setting a session cookie or server-side preference. To fully document this endpoint, additional requests with different headers (Accept-Language, custom language headers) or in different session states would be needed to determine: what triggers a non-empty response, whether it returns available languages, or whether it returns localized strings/resources.", "other": "Path structure indicates this is part of an Infrastructure API subsystem, likely shared across the sobranie.mk platform for common functionality. The endpoint may be called during initial page load or language switching events. Without request/response body content, this capture provides limited insight into the actual API contract. Recommend capturing: (1) requests with language selection parameters, (2) responses when language data is actually returned, (3) any cookies set in response headers that might contain language preferences."}
