{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. POST request with no query string or request body. This endpoint appears to accept an empty POST request.","response_structure":"Empty response body with 200 status code. Content-Type is application/json but returns no actual JSON data. The empty response suggests this may be a state-changing operation (loading language preferences) that doesn't return data, or the language data may be loaded via other means (cookies, session state).","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language loading functionality. The /Infrastructure path prefix suggests this is a utility/system-level endpoint rather than a domain-specific API. Despite being a POST request, it accepts no body and returns no data, indicating it likely: 1) Sets language preferences in session/cookies based on current context, 2) Initializes language resources server-side, or 3) Triggers language file loading. The empty response with successful 200 status suggests side-effects occur (session state, cache initialization) rather than data retrieval. This is unusual for a POST endpoint and may indicate legacy design or internal tooling.","other":"Endpoint categorization: Infrastructure/System utility. HTTP method justification unclear - POST suggests state modification but lack of parameters is atypical. May be called during application initialization or language switching workflows. No authentication tokens or session identifiers visible in this sanitized capture, but likely required in practice. The sobranie.mk domain (Macedonian Parliament) suggests multilingual support is a key requirement. Consider investigating: browser cookies set after this call, subsequent requests that may depend on this initialization, and whether GET requests to related endpoints return language-specific content after this POST."}
