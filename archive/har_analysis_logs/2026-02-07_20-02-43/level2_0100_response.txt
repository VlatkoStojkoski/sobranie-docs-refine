{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. The language selection may be handled via cookies, session data, or HTTP headers (such as Accept-Language).", "response_structure": "Empty response body with 200 OK status. The endpoint likely sets cookies or session variables server-side rather than returning data. Expected response is application/json but contains no content.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for loading or initializing language preferences in the Sobranie (Parliament) system. Part of the /Infrastructure namespace which suggests core system functionality. This appears to be a state-setting endpoint rather than data retrieval. The empty response indicates success/acknowledgment pattern. Likely called during session initialization, language switching, or page load to establish user language preferences for subsequent requests. May work in conjunction with cookies or session storage.", "other": "Endpoint location suggests architectural pattern with Infrastructure as a distinct module/controller. The empty response with application/json content-type is unusual - typically would expect at least a success confirmation object. This might indicate the endpoint's primary purpose is side-effects (setting session state, cookies) rather than data exchange. Worth investigating what cookies or headers are set in the response. Could be part of a multi-step language initialization flow. Consider checking if subsequent requests to other endpoints return localized content after calling this endpoint."}
