{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - RPC-style method identifier; LanguageId (integer, required): Language selector (1 observed, likely 1=Macedonian); Month (integer, required): Month number 1-12; Year (integer, required): Four-digit year (2026 tested)","response_structure":"Empty response observed for January 2026 query. Expected structure likely JSON array or object containing agenda/calendar items when data exists. May include meeting dates, session information, parliamentary agenda items for the specified month/year.","documentation_notes":"RPC-style endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest acting as method dispatcher. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary calendar/agenda for a specific month and year. Empty response may indicate no scheduled events for future date (Jan 2026) or that agenda not yet published. Test with current/past months to observe populated response structure. LanguageId likely corresponds to Macedonian parliamentary languages (1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian possible). This appears to be a generic routing endpoint that accepts different methodName values for various API operations.","other":"sobranie.mk domain indicates North Macedonia Parliament website. Generic routing pattern suggests other methods accessible via same endpoint with different methodName values. Consider testing historical dates (2024-2025) to capture actual agenda data structure. Response may be empty by design for future dates beyond publication window. Endpoint pattern suggests discovery of other methods possible through similar POST requests with different methodName parameters."}
