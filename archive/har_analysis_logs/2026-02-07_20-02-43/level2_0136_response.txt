{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with model object containing: Language (integer, value 1 observed), Month (integer, 1-12 range implied, value 1 observed for January), Year (integer, value 2026 observed). No query parameters. Content-Type: application/json required.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (200 OK status). Expected structure unknown - may return calendar events array when data exists, or service may return empty for future dates. Likely returns JSON array or object with event details when events exist for the specified month/year.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint for retrieving custom calendar events from North Macedonia's Parliament (Sobranie) website. Uses POST with JSON body despite ASMX typically using SOAP/XML. Language parameter likely: 1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian (based on typical sobranie.mk language options). Service path '/Moldova/' appears to be internal routing - actual parliament is North Macedonia. Empty response for January 2026 suggests either no events scheduled or service doesn't return future events beyond certain threshold. Test with current/past dates to determine actual response structure.","other":"Host: www.sobranie.mk. Service location: /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx (ASMX web service, unusual for JSON). Path segment 'Moldova' is misleading - this is North Macedonia's parliament system. The empty response for a future date (2026) may indicate: (1) no events exist for that period, (2) service only returns data for current/past dates, or (3) calendar events not yet populated. Recommend testing with current month/year and known event dates to understand typical response format. Service likely part of parliament's public calendar/scheduling system."}
