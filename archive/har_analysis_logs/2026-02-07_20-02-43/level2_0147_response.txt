{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No request parameters, query parameters, or request body. This endpoint accepts a POST request with no payload.","response_structure":"Empty response body with HTTP 200 status. Returns application/json content-type but the actual response is empty/null, suggesting either initialization without data return or a fire-and-forget operation.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language loading functionality. Located under /Infrastructure namespace suggesting system-level or configuration operation. The empty response indicates this may be a session initialization endpoint that sets language preferences server-side without returning confirmation data. Could be triggered during application bootstrap or language switching. May rely on cookies, session state, or HTTP headers (like Accept-Language) to determine which language to load rather than explicit parameters.","other":"Endpoint path pattern: /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage. No authentication tokens visible in sanitized request. Empty response unusual for API endpoints - may indicate: 1) Server-side session/cookie manipulation only, 2) Possible error condition not reflected in status code, 3) Language preferences stored server-side based on user session, 4) Could be part of initialization sequence called before other API requests. Worth investigating if request headers contain language indicators or if this sets cookies for subsequent requests."}
