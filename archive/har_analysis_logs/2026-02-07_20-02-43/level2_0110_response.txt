{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetVotingResultsForAgendaItem","parameters":"VotingDefinitionId (string/UUID): Identifier for the voting definition (e.g., '721d47fd-6799-4e6d-817b-ac7771ebcf0b'). AgendaItemId (string/UUID): Identifier for the agenda item being voted on (e.g., 'E29B204D-B666-42F8-A7ED-1649A1477B9F'). LanguageId (integer): Language identifier for localization, 1 likely represents Macedonian or default language. All parameters appear required based on the request structure.","response_structure":"Empty response body received (status 200). This could indicate: (1) No voting results exist for this combination of VotingDefinitionId and AgendaItemId, (2) The voting has not been completed yet, (3) Results are restricted/not public, or (4) An error condition that returns empty rather than error status. Expected structure when data exists would likely include: voting statistics (yes/no/abstain counts), individual member votes, timestamps, quorum information, and voting outcome (passed/failed).","documentation_notes":"This endpoint retrieves voting results for specific agenda items in the Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie). Uses a generic routing pattern where the actual API method name is passed in the request body via 'MethodName' parameter. The endpoint follows a proxy/dispatcher pattern (/Routing/MakePostRequest) rather than RESTful conventions. Empty response suggests this particular voting session may not have results recorded yet, or the IDs provided don't match an existing voting record. The combination of VotingDefinitionId and AgendaItemId suggests a many-to-one relationship where multiple voting definitions can exist for a single agenda item (e.g., preliminary vote, final vote, amendments).","other":"Base URL: https://www.sobranie.mk. API Pattern: Generic POST router accepting method name in body rather than URL path-based routing. All API calls appear to route through /Routing/MakePostRequest endpoint with MethodName specifying the actual operation. Both UUID formats observed: lowercase with hyphens and uppercase with hyphens, suggesting case-insensitive handling. LanguageId=1 likely default, other values (2, 3) may represent Albanian, English or other official languages. This is part of a parliamentary information system tracking legislative sessions, agenda items, and voting records. Related methods likely exist for: GetAgendaItems, GetVotingDefinitions, GetSessionDetails, GetMemberVotes."}
