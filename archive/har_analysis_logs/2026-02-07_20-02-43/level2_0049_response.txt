{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the remote method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): language selector, value 1 observed (likely Macedonian as primary language); Month (integer, required): month number 1-12, value 9 (September) in example; Year (integer, required): four-digit year, value 2025 in example","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with HTTP 200 status. This could indicate: (1) no agenda items exist for the requested month/year combination (September 2025), (2) the endpoint returns empty array/object when no data is available, (3) possible future date scenario where data is not yet populated, or (4) the request may have failed silently. Expected structure unknown but likely would be array of agenda items with date, time, title, description fields when data exists.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint that acts as an RPC-style gateway, dispatching to different methods based on the methodName parameter. The MakePostRequest path suggests a centralized routing mechanism rather than RESTful resource-based endpoints. The GetMonthlyAgenda method retrieves parliamentary agenda/schedule data for a specific month and year. The empty response for September 2025 (a future date at time of likely capture) suggests the system may not have forward-looking agenda data populated. Testing with historical dates (past months/years) would likely yield actual agenda data. LanguageId parameter indicates multi-language support in the API.","other":"The sobranie.mk domain belongs to the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia (parliament website). This API pattern with methodName-based routing is common in legacy or ASP.NET-based systems. Other potential method names to discover might follow similar patterns like GetDailyAgenda, GetWeeklyAgenda, GetAgendaDetails, etc. The LanguageId=1 likely corresponds to Macedonian; testing with LanguageId=2 might reveal Albanian or English content. Recommend testing with current/past month-year combinations to observe actual data structure. The routing system may support numerous other methodName values for different parliamentary data endpoints (sessions, members, legislation, voting records, etc.)."}
