{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllSittingStatuses","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetAllSittingStatuses' - Specifies the backend method to invoke. LanguageId (integer, required): 1 - Language identifier for localization (1 likely represents Macedonian or default language)","response_structure":"Empty response body returned. Expected structure unknown - may indicate no sitting statuses exist, an error condition, or the endpoint returns data in a different format than JSON. Typical response would likely be an array of sitting status objects with fields like: id, name, description, isActive, etc.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that acts as a gateway to multiple backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter. This request retrieves all sitting/session statuses for parliamentary sessions. The empty response suggests either: (1) no data available, (2) authentication/authorization failure, (3) the method returns data through a different mechanism, or (4) an error occurred but was not properly communicated. The LanguageId parameter indicates multi-language support throughout the API.","other":"Pattern observed: Universal POST endpoint '/Routing/MakePostRequest' used as a method dispatcher/router rather than RESTful resource-based endpoints. This is a non-RESTful RPC-style API design. All requests appear to route through this single endpoint with the specific operation determined by the methodName field. This suggests other methods can be discovered by varying the methodName parameter. The sobranie.mk domain indicates this is the Parliament of North Macedonia website API."}
