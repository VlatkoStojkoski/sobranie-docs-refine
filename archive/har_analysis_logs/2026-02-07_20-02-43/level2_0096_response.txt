{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"Required object 'model' containing: 'Language' (integer, e.g. 1 for language selection), 'Month' (integer 1-12 for calendar month), 'Year' (integer, e.g. 2026 for calendar year). Content-Type: application/json. All three fields appear mandatory for the calendar event query.","response_structure":"Returns JSON array/collection of calendar events. Empty response in this sample (no events for January 2026), but expected structure would contain event objects with date, title, description, and other event metadata when events exist for the specified month/year.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services). Language parameter suggests multi-language support (likely 1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian, etc. based on sobranie.mk context). Service retrieves custom/special parliamentary calendar events for a specific month/year combination. Empty response may indicate no events scheduled, future date beyond data availability, or inactive calendar period. The 'Custom' in method name suggests these are special events distinct from regular parliamentary sessions.","other":"Domain: sobranie.mk (Assembly of North Macedonia parliament website). Service path indicates Moldova subdirectory which may be location/regional reference or legacy naming. ASMX technology suggests older codebase. Request for future date (2026) returned empty - unclear if this is expected behavior or data limitation. Successful 200 status with empty response suggests valid request format but no matching data."}
