{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllSittingStatuses","parameters":"LanguageId (integer, required) - Language identifier for localization (observed value: 1 for likely Macedonian language). Request body must be JSON with 'methodName' field set to 'GetAllSittingStatuses' and 'LanguageId' field.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned in this capture. Expected structure unknown - likely should return array or object containing sitting status information (e.g., scheduled, in progress, completed, cancelled) but may return empty when no data exists or language parameter is invalid.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint that dispatches to different methods based on the 'methodName' parameter. The GetAllSittingStatuses method appears to retrieve parliamentary sitting statuses. The empty response suggests either no sitting statuses exist in the system, an error occurred silently, or the language ID 1 has no associated data. The endpoint follows a command pattern where the actual API method is determined by the methodName field rather than the URL path. This is common in older or monolithic web applications but makes API discovery more difficult.","other":"Part of sobranie.mk (Assembly of North Macedonia) parliamentary system. The /Routing/MakePostRequest endpoint acts as a universal dispatcher/router rather than RESTful design. Other potential methodName values should be investigated. The LanguageId parameter suggests multi-language support - testing with different values (e.g., 2 for Albanian, 3 for English) recommended. Empty response may indicate authentication requirements, session state dependencies, or that this method returns data only during active parliamentary sessions."}
