{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetVotingResultsForAgendaItem","parameters":"VotingDefinitionId (UUID/GUID string, required) - Identifier for the voting definition (e.g., '80025712-a092-4e4d-8983-e146896368ae'); AgendaItemId (UUID/GUID string, required) - Identifier for the agenda item being voted on (e.g., '2F23C831-6373-40D1-A65F-1C22D9889C17'); LanguageId (integer, required) - Language identifier for localization, appears to use numeric codes where 1 likely represents a specific language (possibly Macedonian given .mk domain)","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (status 200). This could indicate: (1) no voting results exist yet for this combination of VotingDefinitionId and AgendaItemId, (2) the voting session hasn't occurred or been recorded, (3) results are not publicly available, or (4) potential error condition returning empty set. Expected structure when data exists would likely contain voting statistics, individual votes, vote counts (yes/no/abstain), timestamps, and possibly MP voting records.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint (/Routing/MakePostRequest) that acts as a dispatcher/proxy for multiple backend methods. The actual API method being invoked is specified in the MethodName field ('GetVotingResultsForAgendaItem'). This pattern suggests a single-endpoint RPC-style architecture rather than RESTful routes. The sobranie.mk domain indicates this is the Parliament of North Macedonia website. The method retrieves voting results for specific agenda items during parliamentary sessions. Both ID parameters use uppercase GUID format with mixed case hex digits. The empty response in this capture suggests either no results available or the voting hasn't been completed/published yet.","other":"Security consideration: This endpoint appears to be publicly accessible without authentication tokens visible in the request. The generic routing pattern makes API discovery more difficult as all methods funnel through one endpoint. To discover other available methods, would need to enumerate MethodName values. The use of GUIDs for both VotingDefinitionId and AgendaItemId suggests a database-driven system with unique identifiers for each voting session and agenda item. Future testing should verify if response structure changes when actual voting data exists, and explore what other MethodName values are supported by this routing endpoint. Consider testing with historical/completed voting sessions to see populated response structure."}
