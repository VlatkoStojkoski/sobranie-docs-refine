{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName: string (required, value='GetMonthlyAgenda' for this endpoint), LanguageId: integer (required, appears to be language selector where 1 likely represents a specific language such as Macedonian), Month: integer (required, range 1-12 representing calendar month), Year: integer (required, four-digit year format, tested with 2026)","response_structure":"Empty response body returned for the test request (2026-01-01). This could indicate: (1) No agenda items exist for January 2026, (2) The endpoint returns empty array/object when no data is available, (3) Future dates beyond available data return empty. Expected structure when data exists is likely an array of agenda items or events with date, title, description, and related metadata fields typical of parliamentary agenda systems.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a dispatcher for multiple methods. The actual API method is specified via the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. This GetMonthlyAgenda method retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar data for a specific month and year. The routing pattern suggests other methods may be called through the same endpoint by changing the methodName value. LanguageId parameter indicates multilingual support. Testing with future dates (2026) returned empty, suggesting either no forward planning data or validation logic. Recommended to test with current/past dates for populated responses.","other":"Endpoint belongs to sobranie.mk (Assembly/Parliament of North Macedonia). The generic routing mechanism (/Routing/MakePostRequest) is unusual and suggests a facade/proxy pattern rather than RESTful design. No authentication headers observed in request. Response Content-Type is application/json despite empty body. To fully document this API, would need to: (1) Test with historical dates to see populated response structure, (2) Discover other methodName values accepted by this routing endpoint, (3) Determine valid LanguageId values and their mappings, (4) Identify any authentication requirements for restricted methods."}
