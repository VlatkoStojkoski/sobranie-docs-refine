{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: (1) Language (integer, value: 1 - likely language ID where 1 may represent Macedonian or English), (2) Month (integer, range 1-12, value: 1 for January), (3) Year (integer, value: 2026 - supports future date queries). No query parameters. Endpoint follows ASMX web service pattern.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (status 200). Expected structure unknown but likely would return array of calendar events with properties such as event date, title, description, and type when events exist for the requested month/year. Empty response suggests no custom events scheduled for January 2026.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint for Moldova parliament calendar system. Service path: /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx. Method retrieves custom/special calendar events for a specific month and year in a specified language. The 'Custom' prefix suggests this returns non-standard events (possibly parliamentary sessions, committee meetings, or special occasions) as opposed to regular scheduled events. Language parameter enables localization. Response was empty for future date (January 2026), which may indicate either no events scheduled or the system doesn't support queries beyond a certain timeframe.","other":"Domain: sobranie.mk (North Macedonia Parliament website). Technology: ASP.NET ASMX web service (legacy .NET framework web service format). The service structure suggests additional calendar-related methods may exist in CalendarService.asmx. The empty response for a future date (2026) could indicate: (1) no events scheduled yet, (2) date range limitation, or (3) events not yet published. Testing with current/past dates would clarify expected response format. The Language parameter value of 1 should be tested against other values to determine supported languages (likely Macedonian and English as official parliament languages)."}
