{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier (1 observed for Macedonian); Month (integer, required): Month number 1-12 (value: 1); Year (integer, required): Calendar year (value: 2026)","response_structure":"Empty response returned for future date (2026-01). Expected structure unknown but likely returns array of agenda items/events for valid date ranges. Response format: JSON","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that accepts a methodName parameter to dispatch to different backend methods. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar data for a specific month and year. Empty response may indicate no scheduled events for future dates or date validation. The API appears to use a RPC-style pattern where all methods funnel through a single POST endpoint. Language support is built-in via LanguageId parameter.","other":"The request queried a future date (January 2026) which returned empty, suggesting the API either validates date ranges or simply has no data for future dates. To discover full response structure, query historical dates with known parliamentary activity. The routing pattern suggests multiple other methods may be available through the same endpoint by changing methodName. This is part of the North Macedonia Parliament (Sobranie) website API."}
