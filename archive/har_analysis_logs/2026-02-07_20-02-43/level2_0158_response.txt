{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. This endpoint accepts a POST request with no query parameters or request body.","response_structure":"Returns an empty JSON response (status 200). The response body is empty, suggesting this endpoint may perform side effects like setting session language preferences without returning data, or the language data may be cached/stored client-side.","documentation_notes":"This is an infrastructure endpoint for language loading functionality. Located under /Infrastructure path, indicating it's a system-level utility endpoint. The endpoint appears to handle language/localization settings for the Sobranie (Parliament of North Macedonia) website. Despite being a POST request, it requires no input parameters and returns no data, which is unusual. This could indicate: (1) language preference is determined server-side from session/cookies, (2) the endpoint triggers server-side caching or initialization, (3) the response may vary based on Accept-Language headers or cookies not visible in this capture, or (4) this is a legacy endpoint or initialization call made during application bootstrap.","other":"The empty response suggests this might be a fire-and-forget initialization endpoint or a session configuration call. The POST method choice (rather than GET) indicates this may be intended to modify server state or session configuration. May need to analyze accompanying cookies, session tokens, or browser storage to understand the full functionality. Consider testing with different Accept-Language headers or existing session states to determine actual behavior."}
