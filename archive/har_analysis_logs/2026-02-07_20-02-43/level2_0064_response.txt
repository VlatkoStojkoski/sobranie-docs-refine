{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value: 1 indicating language selection), 'Month' (integer, value: 1-12 for calendar month), 'Year' (integer, value: 2026 indicating calendar year).

Expected structure unknown - may return calendar events array when data exists, or empty response indicates no events for specified period (January 2026)","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint for retrieving custom calendar events from North Macedonian Parliament (sobranie.mk). Service path follows classic ASP.NET ASMX pattern (/services/CalendarService.asmx/MethodName). Language parameter likely maps to: 1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian, 3=English (common pattern for sobranie.mk). Request for future date (2026) returned empty, suggesting either no events scheduled or endpoint filters future dates. Path includes 'Moldova' directory which may indicate regional/historical naming","other":"Server: sobranie.mk (North Macedonian Parliament website). Technology stack: ASP.NET ASMX Web Services (legacy .NET framework). The 'Moldova' path segment is notable - likely refers to historical/geographical context rather than the country. Empty response could indicate: (1) no events in January 2026, (2) future dates not supported, (3) data not yet populated for future years. To fully document API, test with current/past dates and different language codes. Consider testing Month values 1-12 and various Year values to determine valid ranges"}
