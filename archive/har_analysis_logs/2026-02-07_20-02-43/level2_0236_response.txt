{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "GetAllStructuresForFilter", "parameters": "methodName (string, required): The internal API method to invoke, value 'GetAllStructuresForFilter'. languageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization, observed value 1 likely represents Macedonian or default language. Posted as JSON body to generic routing endpoint /Routing/MakePostRequest.", "response_structure": "Empty response received in this capture. Expected structure unknown but method name suggests it should return a list or collection of organizational structures/entities available for filtering purposes. Likely returns array of objects with structure metadata (id, name, type, hierarchy information) when data exists or when properly authenticated.", "documentation_notes": "This is a generic RPC-style routing endpoint pattern where the actual method being called is specified in the POST body rather than the URL path. The endpoint acts as a dispatcher/proxy to internal methods. GetAllStructuresForFilter suggests this retrieves organizational or parliamentary structures (committees, working bodies, parliamentary groups) that can be used as filter options in the UI. The empty response may indicate: no data available, authentication required, session expired, or the method requires additional parameters not provided in this request. Common pattern in ASP.NET MVC applications using custom routing handlers.", "other": "The sobranie.mk domain is the Assembly of North Macedonia (parliament website). This routing pattern centralizes all API calls through a single endpoint, making API discovery more difficult as method names are not exposed in URLs. To fully map this API, would need to enumerate all possible methodName values. The languageId parameter suggests multilingual support. Consider testing with languageId values 2, 3 for other languages (likely Albanian, English). Empty response requires investigation - may need cookies/session, CSRF tokens, or different parameter combinations. Check for similar MakePostRequest calls in HAR with successful responses to understand authentication requirements."}
