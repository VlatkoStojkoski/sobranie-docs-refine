{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No request parameters observed. Accepts POST request with empty body. May accept optional language code parameter in actual implementation but not provided in this capture.", "response_structure": "Returns empty response body with 200 OK status. Expected response type is application/json but actual payload is empty, suggesting either: (1) successful operation with no data to return, (2) language resource already loaded/cached, or (3) side-effect operation that updates session/state without returning data.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language management in the Sobranie (Assembly of North Macedonia) website. The endpoint appears to handle language preference loading/initialization. The empty response with JSON content-type indicates this may be a state-changing operation (loading language resources into session or cache) rather than a data-retrieval endpoint. The POST method suggests this modifies server-side state. Typical usage would be during application initialization or language switching. The Infrastructure namespace suggests this is a core system endpoint rather than business logic. May rely on session cookies, headers (Accept-Language), or previously set user preferences to determine which language to load.", "other": "Endpoint location suggests architectural pattern with Infrastructure namespace for cross-cutting concerns. Empty response could indicate async operation, fire-and-forget pattern, or that actual language data is loaded through separate mechanism. Authentication/session state may be required but not evident from this capture. Should test with explicit language parameters (mk, en, sq, etc.) to understand full functionality. Related endpoints likely exist for switching/setting language preferences."}
