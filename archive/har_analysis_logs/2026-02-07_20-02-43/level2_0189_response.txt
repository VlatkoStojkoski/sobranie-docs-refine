{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value: 1), 'Month' (integer, value: 1 for January), 'Year' (integer, value: 2026). All three fields appear required for the calendar query.","response_structure":"Empty response returned (likely no events exist for January 2026). Expected structure unknown but likely returns array of calendar events when data exists. Content-Type is application/json suggesting JSON response format.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services). Part of 'Moldova' subdirectory structure. Retrieves custom calendar events filtered by language, month, and year. Language parameter uses integer codes (1 = likely Macedonian or default language). Month uses standard 1-12 numbering. Empty result may indicate no events scheduled for requested period or that future dates beyond current year return no data.","other":"Service path pattern: /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx/{MethodName}. ASMX services typically also support SOAP protocol alongside JSON REST calls. May have corresponding GetEvents, GetEventDetails, or similar methods. Consider testing with current/past dates to verify response structure with actual data. Language parameter values should be enumerated to understand available translations."}
