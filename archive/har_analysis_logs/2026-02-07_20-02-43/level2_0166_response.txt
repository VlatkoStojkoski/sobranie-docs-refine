{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. This is a POST request with no query parameters and no request body. The endpoint appears to be called without any input data.","response_structure":"Returns an empty JSON response (status 200). The response body is empty, suggesting either: (1) the endpoint sets language preferences via cookies/session rather than returning data, (2) the endpoint failed silently, or (3) language data is loaded client-side after this call triggers some server-side action.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language loading functionality. Part of the /Infrastructure namespace which likely handles cross-cutting concerns like localization, configuration, and system utilities. The endpoint name suggests it loads language resources or sets language preferences for the session. The empty response indicates this is likely a state-changing operation rather than a data retrieval endpoint. This may trigger server-side language configuration that affects subsequent requests. Common pattern in multi-lingual applications where language selection triggers resource loading or session state updates.","other":"This endpoint follows a module/action naming pattern (/Infrastructure/LoadLanguage). No authentication headers visible in the sanitized request. The empty response with 200 status suggests successful execution despite no data return. May need to examine cookies, session storage, or subsequent requests to understand full impact. Likely called during application initialization or language switching events. Consider testing with different Accept-Language headers or checking if there are companion endpoints like /Infrastructure/SetLanguage or /Infrastructure/GetLanguage."}
