{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"/GetParliamentaryGroupDetails","parameters":"parliamentaryGroupId (UUID, required): Identifier for the parliamentary group (e.g., '6f83cbd1-af39-44e5-bfd0-0cde68932844'); LanguageId (integer, required): Language selection identifier (1 appears to be default, likely Macedonian); methodName (string, required): Internal routing parameter specifying the target method","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with HTTP 200 status. Expected structure unknown - may indicate: (1) invalid parliamentaryGroupId, (2) no data available for this group, (3) error condition not properly communicated, or (4) successful operation with no content to return","documentation_notes":"This is a proxy/routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that dispatches to internal methods. The actual method being called is '/GetParliamentaryGroupDetails' specified in the request body. The endpoint follows a non-RESTful pattern where POST is used for all operations and the method name is passed as a parameter. The empty response suggests this particular parliamentaryGroupId may be invalid or the group has no details to return. This routing pattern is consistent with other sobranie.mk API calls observed.","other":"The UUID format for parliamentaryGroupId suggests a database primary key. LanguageId=1 likely corresponds to Macedonian language. The empty response makes it unclear what a successful response would contain - typical parliamentary group details might include: group name, leader information, member count, political affiliation, formation date, etc. Consider testing with different parliamentaryGroupId values to determine valid identifiers and expected response structure."}
