{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters in URL query string or request body. Method accepts POST request with empty body. May rely on session cookies, authentication headers, or Accept-Language header to determine language context.", "response_structure": "Returns empty JSON response with 200 OK status. Response Content-Type is application/json but body is empty, suggesting either: (1) language data loaded into session server-side without return value, (2) operation completed successfully with no data to return, or (3) default language already loaded requiring no data transfer.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for loading language/localization data. Part of the Infrastructure controller/namespace. Likely sets user language preference or initializes language resources for the session. The empty response suggests this is a fire-and-forget operation that configures server-side session state rather than returning language data to client. May trigger session update, cookie setting, or server-side cache initialization. Subsequent API calls likely use the language preference set by this endpoint.", "other": "Endpoint path suggests MVC/API structure with Infrastructure as controller. The empty POST body and empty response indicate this may be legacy endpoint or placeholder. Modern implementations typically return confirmation object with language code/status. Consider checking response headers for Set-Cookie or other session-related headers. This endpoint may work in conjunction with /Infrastructure/GetLanguage or similar retrieval endpoints. The sobranie.mk domain (Macedonian Parliament) suggests multilingual support is critical functionality."}
