{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization (1 observed). Month (integer, required): Month number 1-12 (value: 1). Year (integer, required): Four-digit year (value: 2026).","response_structure":"Empty response returned for this request. Expected structure unknown - may return agenda/calendar data for valid date ranges, possibly array of events or meeting objects. Empty response could indicate: no scheduled events for January 2026, future date not yet populated, or invalid date range.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that dispatches to different methods based on methodName parameter. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar for specified month and year. The empty response for January 2026 suggests data may only be available for current/past dates or near-future dates. Language support indicated by LanguageId parameter. Standard POST-based RPC pattern wrapping the actual method call.","other":"Request made through generic /Routing/MakePostRequest dispatcher rather than REST endpoint. Future date (2026) queried returned empty - likely no data exists yet or endpoint restricts future date queries. Test with current/recent months to discover actual response structure. Other potential methodName values should be discoverable through similar requests or client-side code inspection."}
