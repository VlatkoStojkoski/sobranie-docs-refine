{"route_type": "GET", "method_name": "getMpsClubsTemplate", "parameters": "None - This is a static HTML template file request with no query parameters or request body", "response_structure": "text/html - Returns an empty HTML template file (0 bytes). This appears to be a client-side template file that would normally be populated by JavaScript, possibly for displaying Members of Parliament (MPs) and their parliamentary clubs/groups", "documentation_notes": "This endpoint retrieves an HTML template for the MPs clubs section. The path structure '/Scripts/Moldova/mps-clubs/' suggests this is part of a modular client-side application architecture where HTML templates are loaded separately. The 'Moldova' directory name is notable and may indicate this is related to the Moldova script/template system used by the Macedonian Parliament website. The empty response (0 bytes) could indicate: 1) The template file is genuinely empty and populated entirely by JavaScript, 2) An error condition where the file exists but has no content, or 3) The template is loaded but its content is injected dynamically. This is likely used in conjunction with JavaScript frameworks for single-page application (SPA) functionality to display parliamentary club/caucus information.", "other": "File Location: /Scripts/Moldova/mps-clubs/mps-clubs.html - This follows a pattern suggesting a larger template system. The 'Scripts' directory typically contains JavaScript and associated resources, but this HTML file appears to be a template rather than executable script. The naming convention 'mps-clubs' (Members of Parliament - Clubs/Parliamentary Groups) indicates this is part of the legislative information system for displaying political groupings within the parliament. No authentication headers observed. No rate limiting headers visible. This is a public resource. Related endpoints likely exist for: /Scripts/Moldova/mps-clubs/mps-clubs.js (JavaScript), /Scripts/Moldova/mps-clubs/mps-clubs.css (styling), and API endpoints that would populate this template with actual MP and club data"}
