{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. It appears to be triggered by user action or application state to load language resources for the current session.","response_structure":"Empty response body with 200 OK status. The endpoint likely sets session state or cookies server-side rather than returning data. May also trigger client-side language resource loading through other mechanisms (headers, cookies, or subsequent requests).","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language loading functionality. Part of the /Infrastructure namespace which suggests system-level operations. The empty response with successful status indicates this is likely a trigger endpoint that initiates server-side language configuration. May set Accept-Language headers, session cookies, or locale preferences. This endpoint would typically be called during application initialization, language switching, or session establishment. The lack of parameters suggests it might read language preference from cookies, session data, or browser headers.","other":"Pattern suggests this is part of a multi-step language loading process. The empty response is unusual - typically language endpoints return translation dictionaries or locale data. This may be: (1) A session initializer that prepares language context, (2) A cache-warming endpoint, (3) Part of a two-phase load where actual language data comes from separate static resources or CDN. Related endpoints likely exist for getting available languages, setting language preference, or retrieving translation resources. Consider checking for subsequent requests to static language files (JSON/XML) or CDN resources after this call."}
