{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - identifies the backend method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): language identifier (1 likely represents Macedonian or default language); Month (integer, required): month number (1-12) for which to retrieve agenda; Year (integer, required): year for which to retrieve agenda (tested with 2026)","response_structure":"Empty response returned for the test case (Month: 1, Year: 2026). Expected structure unknown but likely returns JSON array or object containing monthly agenda items, parliamentary sessions, or scheduled events. Empty response may indicate no agenda items exist for future date (January 2026) or the endpoint requires valid date ranges.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that acts as a facade/dispatcher for multiple backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the POST body. The endpoint follows a command pattern where different methods can be called through the same URL by changing the methodName parameter. This architectural pattern suggests multiple methods are available through this single routing endpoint. The GetMonthlyAgenda method specifically retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar data for a given month and year with language support.","other":"The routing pattern suggests additional methods may be discoverable by changing the methodName parameter. The endpoint is part of the Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie) website API. LanguageId parameter indicates multilingual support. The empty response for a future date (2026) suggests the API may only return data for dates with actual scheduled events or may have validation for reasonable date ranges. To discover valid response structure, testing with current or past dates where parliamentary sessions occurred would be necessary. The generic routing mechanism (/Routing/MakePostRequest) is unusual and may be used to abstract multiple backend services."}
