{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCommitteeDetails","parameters":"committeeId (UUID string, required) - Unique identifier for the committee (e.g., 'bb8e23a1-c959-4818-8e6e-ebe450847fd8'); languageId (integer, required) - Language identifier for localization (1 appears to be default, likely Macedonian)","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (status 200). Expected structure unknown - may return committee details object with properties like name, description, members, meeting schedules, or may indicate no data available for the given committeeId. Further investigation needed with valid committee IDs.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that dispatches to different methods based on the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. This pattern suggests a single-endpoint API gateway architecture. The GetCommitteeDetails method retrieves detailed information about parliamentary committees. The empty response may indicate: (1) invalid/non-existent committeeId, (2) committee data not available, (3) authorization/session issue, or (4) API error without proper error response. Standard pattern for this API appears to be: send POST to /Routing/MakePostRequest with methodName field specifying the action and additional parameters as needed.","other":"HAR source: sobranie.mk (North Macedonia Parliament website). This is part of a larger API discovery effort for parliamentary data access. The UUID format for committeeId suggests a database-backed system. Language support indicated by languageId parameter suggests multilingual content availability. To fully document this endpoint, need to: (1) obtain valid committee IDs from listing endpoints, (2) test with different languageId values, (3) capture successful responses to document schema. Related methods likely exist for listing committees, getting members, sessions, etc. using the same routing pattern."}
