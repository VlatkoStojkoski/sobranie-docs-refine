{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. This is a POST request to /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage with no query string parameters and no request body.","response_structure":"Returns HTTP 200 with empty JSON response body. The response appears to be an empty object or array, suggesting either initialization state or a no-op operation.","documentation_notes":"This endpoint appears to be part of the infrastructure layer for language/localization handling in the sobranie.mk (Assembly of North Macedonia) website. The method name 'LoadLanguage' suggests it may be used to initialize or load language resources. The empty response could indicate: (1) language data is set via cookies/session rather than returned in response, (2) this is a state initialization endpoint, (3) default language is already loaded, or (4) the endpoint expects additional parameters not captured in this request. The /Infrastructure/ path prefix suggests this is a utility/system endpoint rather than a primary API endpoint.","other":"No authentication headers visible in capture. Content-Type response is application/json despite empty body. This may be called during page initialization or language switching operations. The endpoint naming follows conventional .NET/MVC patterns common in ASP.NET applications. Further investigation needed to determine if this endpoint accepts optional parameters for language selection (e.g., language code) or if language preference is managed through other mechanisms like Accept-Language headers or session state."}
