{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllPoliticalParties","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetAllPoliticalParties' - specifies the server-side method to invoke; languageId (integer, required): 1 - language identifier for localization, likely 1=Macedonian; StructureId (string, required): '5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473' - UUID format identifier, possibly representing parliamentary structure, term, or session context","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with HTTP 200 status. This could indicate: (1) no political parties exist for the given StructureId, (2) the method executed successfully but returns no data, (3) potential error in request parameters, or (4) the endpoint may require authentication/session context not present in this request","documentation_notes":"This is a generic RPC-style endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a dispatcher/router to various backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. The GetAllPoliticalParties method appears designed to retrieve political party information from the Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie) system. The StructureId parameter suggests this API is structure-aware and may return different results based on parliamentary terms or organizational contexts. The empty response suggests either no data exists for this StructureId or there may be additional requirements (authentication, valid session, correct permissions) not met in this request.","other":"API Pattern: RPC-style POST endpoint using method routing rather than RESTful resource paths. Base URL: https://www.sobranie.mk - official Macedonian Parliament website. The use of UUIDs for StructureId suggests a well-structured backend database. LanguageId=1 implies multi-language support (likely Macedonian, Albanian, English given North Macedonia's linguistic context). This endpoint pattern suggests there are likely many other methodName values available (GetMembers, GetSessions, GetLegislation, etc.). The empty response warrants further investigation with different StructureId values or authentication tokens to determine normal response format."}
