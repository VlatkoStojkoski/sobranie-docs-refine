{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. This endpoint accepts POST requests with no query parameters or request body. It appears to be a language/localization initialization endpoint.","response_structure":"Returns empty JSON response (status 200). The response body is empty, suggesting this may be a fire-and-forget endpoint or returns data through headers/cookies rather than response body.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for loading language settings. Located under /Infrastructure namespace, indicating this is a system-level utility endpoint rather than a business logic endpoint. The empty response suggests this endpoint may: (1) set language preferences in session/cookies, (2) initialize server-side language state, (3) trigger background language resource loading, or (4) be called for side effects rather than data retrieval. The POST method suggests state modification on the server. May need to check response headers for Set-Cookie or other language preference indicators. This endpoint likely works in conjunction with other language/localization mechanisms in the application.","other":"Part of the Infrastructure module/namespace. Empty response body is unusual for an API endpoint - warrants investigation of headers, cookies, and client-side behavior. May be called during application initialization or language switching. Consider analyzing subsequent requests to see if language preference affects other API responses. The sobranie.mk domain (Macedonian Parliament) suggests this handles Macedonian/Albanian/English language switching common in North Macedonian government sites."}
