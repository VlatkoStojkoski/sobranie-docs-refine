{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. It appears to rely on session/cookie data or server-side context to determine the language to load.", "response_structure": "Empty response body. Status 200 indicates success, but no data is returned. This suggests the endpoint may set cookies, session variables, or trigger server-side state changes rather than returning language data directly.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language loading functionality. The /Infrastructure namespace suggests this is a system-level utility endpoint. Despite the name 'LoadLanguage', it returns no content, which indicates it may: (1) set language preference in session/cookies, (2) initialize server-side language context, or (3) be a legacy endpoint. The empty response suggests side effects rather than data retrieval. This may be called during application initialization or language switching workflows. No authentication headers visible in the request, suggesting it may be publicly accessible.", "other": "Unusual pattern: POST method with no body and empty response. This deviates from typical REST conventions where POST expects input and returns created/modified resources. The endpoint name suggests GET would be more semantically appropriate if it were retrieving language data. May be part of a larger language management system on the Sobranie (Parliament) website. Consider testing with language preference cookies or headers to understand full behavior. Could be paired with other Infrastructure endpoints for complete functionality."}
