{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"Required JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value 1 observed - likely language ID where 1 may represent Macedonian), 'Month' (integer, range 1-12 for calendar month), 'Year' (integer, four-digit year like 2026). All three fields appear required for the calendar query.","response_structure":"Expected: JSON array or object containing calendar events. Observed: Empty response for future date (January 2026), suggesting no events scheduled or endpoint returns empty for dates without events. Normal responses likely contain event objects with properties such as date, title, description, event type, etc.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services). Part of Moldova assembly/parliament calendar system. Retrieves custom events for specified month/year in specified language. Empty response for 2026 suggests either no future events are loaded in system or endpoint only returns historical/current data. The 'Custom' in method name suggests these are user-defined or special parliamentary events vs standard sessions. URL path '/Moldova/' indicates multi-tenant or region-specific deployment.","other":"Service location: /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx (ASMX SOAP/JSON hybrid service). The .asmx extension with /MethodName pattern indicates ASP.NET ScriptService with JSON support enabled. Consider testing with current/past dates to observe actual event structure. Language parameter mapping should be documented (1=Macedonian?, 2=Albanian?, etc.). Month/Year validation ranges unknown. Related endpoints likely exist: GetEventsCalendar, GetSessionCalendar, etc."}
