{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetVotingResultsForAgendaItem","parameters":"VotingDefinitionId (string/UUID): Unique identifier for the voting definition (e.g., '33e1520c-59ae-44d2-90a3-4e1986d8870d'). AgendaItemId (string/UUID): Unique identifier for the agenda item being voted on (e.g., 'A80609AB-F82D-4844-AAF9-BEEAA5ED2462'). LanguageId (integer): Language selector for localized content (1 = Macedonian or primary language). MethodName (string): Internal routing parameter set to 'GetVotingResultsForAgendaItem'.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (status 200). Expected structure likely contains voting results with vote counts, individual MP votes, timestamps, and outcome status, but this particular request returned no data - possibly indicating no voting results available for this specific VotingDefinitionId/AgendaItemId combination, or the voting has not yet occurred.","documentation_notes":"This endpoint retrieves voting results for a specific agenda item in the Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie). The routing mechanism uses a generic POST endpoint '/Routing/MakePostRequest' with the actual method specified in the MethodName field. The empty response suggests either: (1) voting has not taken place yet for this agenda item, (2) results are not yet available/published, (3) the IDs provided don't match any existing voting record, or (4) the data is restricted. The dual identifier system (VotingDefinitionId + AgendaItemId) indicates a many-to-many relationship where multiple votings can occur on a single agenda item. LanguageId parameter suggests multilingual support (likely Macedonian and Albanian as official languages, plus English).","other":"Base URL: https://www.sobranie.mk. This appears to be part of a client-side routing architecture where all API calls go through a single POST endpoint with method names specified in the body. Similar to RPC-style APIs. The UUID format mixing (lowercase with hyphens vs uppercase with hyphens) suggests different data sources or legacy system integration. Security consideration: UUIDs appear to be sequential/predictable which could allow enumeration of voting records. Consider checking if authentication/session tokens are required in headers for actual data retrieval."}
