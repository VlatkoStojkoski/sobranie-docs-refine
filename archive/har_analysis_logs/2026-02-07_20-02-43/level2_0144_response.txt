{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllSittings","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetAllSittings' - specifies the remote method to invoke; Page (integer, required): pagination page number, starts at 1; Rows (integer, required): number of results per page (10 in example); LanguageId (integer, required): language identifier (1 observed, likely Macedonian); TypeId (integer, required): type filter for sittings (1 observed); CommitteeId (integer|null, optional): filter by committee identifier; StatusId (integer|null, optional): filter by sitting status; DateFrom (string|null, optional): start date filter for sitting date range; DateTo (string|null, optional): end date filter for sitting date range; SessionId (integer|null, optional): filter by parliamentary session; Number (integer|null, optional): filter by sitting number; StructureId (string, required): UUID identifying organizational structure ('5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473' observed)","response_structure":"Empty response body received in this capture. Expected structure unknown but likely returns paginated list of parliamentary sittings with metadata including total count, current page, and array of sitting objects containing details like date, type, committee, status, session, and number based on filter parameters provided","documentation_notes":"This is a generic RPC-style routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that dispatches to different backend methods based on methodName parameter. GetAllSittings retrieves parliamentary sitting records with extensive filtering and pagination capabilities. The endpoint accepts null values for optional filters. StructureId appears to be a required organizational identifier possibly representing the parliamentary body or term. LanguageId=1 suggests multilingual support. Empty response may indicate no results matching criteria or potential error condition not reflected in HTTP status","other":"The routing pattern suggests a single POST endpoint handling multiple methods via methodName dispatch rather than RESTful resource-based routing. This is common in RPC-style APIs. The StructureId UUID format suggests a specific parliament structure/term identifier. All date filters accept null, indicating they're truly optional. The combination of TypeId, CommitteeId, StatusId, SessionId, and Number provides granular filtering of parliamentary sittings. Response was empty which is unusual - may need to test with different parameter combinations or date ranges to get actual data"}
