{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllCouncils","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetAllCouncils' - specifies the backend method to invoke; languageId (integer, required): 1 - language identifier for localization (likely 1=Macedonian); StructureId (string, required): UUID format '5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473' - identifier for organizational structure or council hierarchy","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with HTTP 200 status. Expected structure unknown - may return array of council objects with properties like councilId, name, description, members, or structure details when data exists. Empty response could indicate: no councils found for given StructureId, invalid parameters, or data access issue","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a proxy/dispatcher to various backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. This pattern suggests a centralized API gateway architecture. The GetAllCouncils method appears designed to retrieve all councils within a parliamentary structure. The empty response warrants investigation - may need different StructureId or this could be an error condition not properly reflected in status code","other":"API Pattern: RPC-style POST endpoint using methodName routing rather than RESTful resource paths. Parliament context: sobranie.mk is the Macedonian Parliament website. The StructureId UUID likely references a specific parliamentary session, term, or organizational unit. Language support indicated by languageId parameter. Consider testing with languageId values 2+ for other languages (possibly Albanian, English). Investigate if other methodNames are available through this routing endpoint (GetCouncilById, GetCouncilMembers, etc). Empty response needs clarification - verify if this StructureId is valid or if authentication/authorization is required"}
