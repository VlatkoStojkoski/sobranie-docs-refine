{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier (1 appears to be default/Macedonian), Month (integer, required): Month number (1-12), Year (integer, required): Year in YYYY format (tested with 2026)","response_structure":"Empty response returned for future date (2026-01). Expected structure unknown but likely returns JSON array or object containing agenda/calendar items for the specified month when data exists. Response appears to be empty when no events are scheduled or for future dates beyond available data.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a dispatcher to multiple backend methods. The actual API method is specified via the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. GetMonthlyAgenda appears to retrieve parliamentary agenda/schedule data for a specific month and year. The empty response for January 2026 suggests either no data exists for future dates, or the parliamentary calendar has not been populated that far in advance. To get actual data, try current or past dates. The LanguageId parameter suggests multi-language support on the sobranie.mk (North Macedonia Parliament) website.","other":"This is part of the North Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie) website API. The generic routing pattern suggests there are likely many other methodName values available beyond GetMonthlyAgenda. Common related methods might include GetDailyAgenda, GetAgendaDetails, GetSessionInfo, etc. The endpoint appears to use a POST-based RPC style rather than RESTful conventions. To discover the API surface, would need to examine frontend JavaScript code or other HAR requests to identify additional methodName values. Testing with current/past dates recommended to see actual response structure."}
