{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllSittingStatuses","parameters":"LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization. Value 1 observed in capture, likely representing Macedonian or another primary language. Request body uses JSON format with two properties: methodName (string) specifying the backend method to invoke, and LanguageId (integer) for language selection.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with HTTP 200 status. This could indicate: (1) no sitting statuses exist in the system, (2) the method executed successfully but returns no data for the given language, (3) possible error condition masked by 200 status, or (4) timing issue where data wasn't available at request time. Expected structure would likely be JSON array of sitting status objects with properties like id, name, description, or similar status-related fields.","documentation_notes":"This endpoint uses a generic routing pattern where the actual method name is passed as a parameter rather than being part of the URL structure. The /Routing/MakePostRequest path acts as a dispatcher/router that invokes backend methods dynamically. GetAllSittingStatuses suggests retrieval of parliamentary sitting status types (e.g., scheduled, in progress, completed, cancelled). The empty response is noteworthy and may require investigation - it could be a data availability issue or incomplete implementation. This pattern is common in ASP.NET applications using a single endpoint for multiple operations.","other":"Application appears to be for the Parliament of North Macedonia (sobranie.mk). The routing pattern suggests an RPC-style API rather than RESTful design. Similar requests in the HAR file likely follow the same pattern with different methodName values. Content-Type is application/json for both request and response. No authentication tokens or session identifiers visible in this sanitized capture. The generic routing mechanism may make API discovery more challenging as available methods aren't exposed through URL structure."}
