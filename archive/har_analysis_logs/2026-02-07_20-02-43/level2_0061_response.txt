{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetSittingDetails","parameters":"SittingId (string/UUID): Unique identifier for a parliamentary sitting session (e.g., '9eb99034-489c-4fc3-8003-52724a2d1dba'). LanguageId (integer): Language selector where 1 likely represents Macedonian (primary language). MethodName (string): Internal routing parameter specifying the target method to invoke ('GetSittingDetails').","response_structure":"Empty response returned in this capture. Expected response would likely contain sitting details such as: date/time of sitting, agenda items, participating members,議題topics discussed, voting records, session status, duration, and related documents. Structure unknown due to empty response - may indicate sitting not found, no data available, or server error without error message.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as an RPC-style gateway. The actual method being invoked is specified in the request body via 'MethodName' parameter rather than REST-style URL paths. This pattern suggests a centralized routing mechanism where multiple different API methods are accessed through the same endpoint. The sobranie.mk domain indicates this is the official website of the Assembly of North Macedonia. GetSittingDetails retrieves information about parliamentary sitting sessions. The empty response suggests either: (1) the sitting ID doesn't exist, (2) no details are available for this sitting, (3) an error occurred without proper error messaging, or (4) the sitting data hasn't been populated yet. Language support indicates multilingual capability for parliamentary records.","other":"Domain: www.sobranie.mk (Assembly/Parliament of North Macedonia). This RPC-style routing pattern is unusual for modern REST APIs but common in legacy or internal systems. The endpoint likely supports multiple MethodName values for different parliamentary data operations (e.g., GetMembers, GetLegislation, GetVotingRecords, etc.). Authentication may not be required for public parliamentary data. Empty response without error status suggests poor error handling - properly designed APIs should return error objects with descriptive messages. Consider testing with valid sitting IDs from current parliamentary sessions. The UUID format for SittingId suggests a database-backed system with GUID primary keys. Future API discovery should enumerate other valid MethodName values by examining additional HAR captures or client-side JavaScript code."}
