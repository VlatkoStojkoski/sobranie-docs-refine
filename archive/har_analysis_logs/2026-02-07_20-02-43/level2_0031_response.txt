{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the backend method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): language identifier (1 observed, likely Macedonian or primary language); Month (integer, required): month number 1-12 for agenda retrieval (1 observed); Year (integer, required): four-digit year for agenda retrieval (2026 observed in test data)","response_structure":"Empty response body returned in this capture. Expected structure unknown but likely JSON array or object containing monthly agenda/calendar events for the specified month/year. May include parliamentary sessions, committee meetings, legislative events, or other parliamentary activities scheduled for the requested period.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that acts as a dispatcher/proxy for multiple backend methods. The actual operation is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the POST body. Request format follows consistent pattern: POST to /Routing/MakePostRequest with JSON body containing methodName and method-specific parameters. Empty response may indicate: (1) no events scheduled for January 2026, (2) future date with no data yet, (3) error condition not properly returned, or (4) this is test/development data. The sobranie.mk domain suggests this is the Macedonian Parliament website API. LanguageId=1 likely corresponds to Macedonian language, with other IDs potentially for Albanian or English translations.","other":"Endpoint pattern suggests RPC-style API rather than RESTful design. The /Routing/MakePostRequest path serves as universal entry point for multiple operations. Security consideration: ensure proper authentication/authorization if implemented. Future testing should: verify response structure with known valid date ranges, test different LanguageId values, validate Month/Year boundary conditions, check error handling for invalid parameters. Related methods likely exist following same pattern (GetWeeklyAgenda, GetDailyAgenda, GetYearlyAgenda, etc.). Consider checking for API versioning, rate limiting, and CORS policies."}
