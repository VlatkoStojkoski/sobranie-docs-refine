{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value 1 observed), 'Month' (integer, 1-12 range, value 1 observed for January), 'Year' (integer, value 2026 observed). No query parameters. Endpoint follows ASMX web service pattern.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (200 OK status). Expected structure unknown - may return calendar events array when data exists, or empty for future dates with no scheduled events. Content-Type is application/json despite empty body.","documentation_notes":"CalendarService.asmx endpoint for Macedonian Parliament (sobranie.mk) calendar system. Path includes '/Moldova/' subdirectory which may indicate localization or regional routing. Language parameter likely controls response language (1 may represent Macedonian). Request was made for January 2026, a future date at time of capture, which may explain empty response. Service returns custom/special events for specified month and year combination.","other":"ASMX (ASP.NET XML Web Services) legacy technology indicated by .asmx extension. Service uses JSON over ASMX rather than SOAP, suggesting REST-like wrapper over legacy infrastructure. Empty response for future date suggests no events scheduled or calendar only contains historical data. To fully document API, test with current/past dates and different Language values (likely 1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian based on North Macedonia's official languages). Related endpoints likely exist: GetEventsCalendar, GetCalendarByDate, etc."}
