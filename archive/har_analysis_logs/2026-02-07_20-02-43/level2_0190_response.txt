{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"/GetAllQuestions","parameters":"LanguageId (integer, required): Language selector, value 1 likely represents Macedonian. CurrentPage (integer): Current page number for pagination, set to 1. Page (integer): Target page number for pagination, set to 3. Rows (integer): Number of rows per page, set to 15. SearchText (string, optional): Free text search filter, empty in this request. RegistrationNumber (string, optional): Filter by registration number, empty in this request. StatusId (integer, nullable): Filter by status ID, null in this request. From (string, optional): Date range start filter, empty in this request. To (string, optional): Date range end filter, empty in this request. CommitteeId (integer, nullable): Filter by committee identifier, null in this request. DateFrom (datetime, nullable): Alternative date range start, null in this request. DateTo (datetime, nullable): Alternative date range end, null in this request. StructureId (string/GUID, required): Parliamentary structure identifier, value '5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473' indicates specific organizational unit or session.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with HTTP 200 status. Expected structure unknown - this may indicate: (1) no questions exist matching the criteria, (2) an error condition that returns empty rather than error code, (3) page 3 exceeds available data when only 15 rows per page are configured, or (4) the StructureId provided has no associated questions. Normal response would likely contain JSON array or object with question records including fields such as question ID, text, submitter, date, status, and committee information.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a proxy/dispatcher for multiple API methods. The actual method being invoked is specified in the 'methodName' field of the POST body (/GetAllQuestions). This architectural pattern suggests the backend uses a single entry point for multiple operations. The endpoint retrieves parliamentary questions with extensive filtering capabilities including text search, date ranges, committee assignment, status, and registration numbers. Pagination is supported with both CurrentPage and Page parameters (their distinction is unclear - may be redundant or serve different purposes in navigation vs. display). The StructureId appears to be a key parameter for scoping queries to specific parliamentary structures or sessions. Language selection suggests multilingual support. The empty response in this capture requires further investigation with different parameter combinations to understand normal response format.","other":"Potential issues identified: (1) Dual pagination parameters (CurrentPage=1, Page=3) suggest possible API design inconsistency or legacy compatibility, (2) Date filtering has two sets of parameters (From/To strings vs DateFrom/DateTo nullables) indicating possible format flexibility or migration between versions, (3) Empty response prevents validation of actual data structure, (4) No error message despite empty return suggests either valid empty result set or missing error handling, (5) The GUID format of StructureId (5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473) indicates database-level identifiers rather than human-readable codes. Recommended testing: try Page=1 to verify data exists, test without StructureId to see if required, experiment with different LanguageId values, and test with SearchText populated to understand query behavior."}
