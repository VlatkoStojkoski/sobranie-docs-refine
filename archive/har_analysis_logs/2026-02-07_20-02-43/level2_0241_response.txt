{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the backend method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): 1 for one language option, likely Macedonian=1 (other values unknown); Month (integer, required): 1-12 representing calendar month; Year (integer, required): four-digit year (e.g., 2026)","response_structure":"Empty response body returned for this request. Expected structure unknown - likely returns array of agenda items with date, title, description, event type fields when data exists for the specified month/year. Empty may indicate no scheduled parliamentary sessions/events for January 2026 or future dates return no data.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that acts as a dispatcher for multiple backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' field in POST body. Pattern suggests other methods likely exist using same endpoint with different methodName values. The request queries for parliamentary monthly agenda/calendar. Testing with past dates vs future dates recommended to understand data availability. LanguageId parameter suggests multilingual support - test with values 1, 2 to identify language mappings (likely 1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian based on North Macedonia's official languages).","other":"URL pattern /Routing/MakePostRequest indicates a generic RPC-style API gateway rather than RESTful design. This single endpoint likely handles many different operations based on methodName. Future reverse engineering should focus on discovering other valid methodName values. The sobranie.mk domain is the Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia. Related methods might include: GetWeeklyAgenda, GetDailyAgenda, GetSessionDetails, GetLegislation, GetMPInfo, etc. Empty response for future date (2026) suggests API may only return historical/current data or that no events are scheduled yet."}
