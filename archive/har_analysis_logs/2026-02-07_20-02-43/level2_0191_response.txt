{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. This is a POST request to /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage with no query string parameters and no request body. The endpoint appears to accept empty POST requests.","response_structure":"Returns HTTP 200 with application/json content type. Response body is empty, suggesting either: (1) the endpoint returns an empty JSON object/array, (2) the operation is purely side-effect based (e.g., setting session/cookie data), or (3) the response may vary based on session state or cookies not visible in this capture.","documentation_notes":"This appears to be an infrastructure/utility endpoint for language management, likely part of the website's internationalization system. Given the name 'LoadLanguage' and empty response, this endpoint probably: (1) initializes or loads language resources server-side, (2) sets language preferences in session/cookie storage, or (3) retrieves language data that wasn't captured in this particular request. The endpoint is under the /Infrastructure path, suggesting it's a system-level utility rather than domain-specific business logic. The POST method indicates it may be performing a state-changing operation rather than just retrieving data.","other":"URL pattern: /Infrastructure/{Action}. This suggests other infrastructure endpoints may exist following the same pattern. No authentication headers or tokens visible in this capture. No error handling observed since request succeeded with 200. The empty response body is unusual for a 'Load' operation - typically would expect language data, configuration, or at least a success indicator. May need to examine cookies, session storage, or subsequent requests to understand full behavior. Consider testing with different Accept-Language headers or language parameters to document complete API behavior."}
