{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. This is a POST request to /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage with no query string parameters and no request body.","response_structure":"Returns HTTP 200 with application/json content-type. Response body is empty, suggesting this endpoint may initialize or set language preferences server-side without returning data, or the response may be empty when language data is already loaded/cached.","documentation_notes":"This appears to be an infrastructure/utility endpoint for language localization. The empty response suggests this might be a state-changing operation (loading language resources into session/cache) rather than a data retrieval endpoint. The POST method indicates it may trigger server-side language resource initialization. Could be called during application bootstrap or language switching. The endpoint is under /Infrastructure namespace suggesting internal system functionality rather than public API.","other":"Endpoint path structure follows /Infrastructure/* pattern. No authentication tokens or headers visible in sanitized data. Empty response with 200 status could indicate success without return payload, or might return data only on first call or when language change is requested. May need to examine cookies or session state to understand full behavior. Could be part of a larger language management system where actual language data is retrieved through other endpoints."}
