{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMaterialDetails","parameters":"MaterialId (UUID string, required) - Identifier for the material/document to retrieve; LanguageId (integer, required) - Language selection for content (1 appears to be default/Macedonian); AmendmentsPage (integer, required) - Pagination control for amendments section; AmendmentsRows (integer, required) - Number of amendment rows per page","response_structure":"Empty response body returned in this capture. Expected structure unknown - may return material/document details including amendments when valid MaterialId is provided. Response format likely JSON based on Content-Type header.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that dispatches to different methods based on the 'methodName' parameter. The GetMaterialDetails method appears to retrieve parliamentary material/document details with pagination support for amendments. The empty response suggests either: (1) invalid MaterialId, (2) no data available for this material, or (3) error condition not properly communicated. The UUID format for MaterialId and structured pagination parameters indicate a formal parliamentary document management system. LanguageId=1 likely represents Macedonian language as primary.","other":"URL domain sobranie.mk is the Assembly of North Macedonia (parliament website). This appears to be part of a document/legislation tracking system. The routing pattern suggests a single-endpoint architecture where all POST requests go through /Routing/MakePostRequest and are internally dispatched based on methodName. This is an RPC-style API design rather than RESTful. The pagination parameters (AmendmentsPage, AmendmentsRows) specifically target amendments subsection, suggesting materials can have associated amendments that require separate pagination from main content. Consider testing with known valid MaterialIds to discover actual response structure."}
