{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetVotingResultsForAgendaItem","parameters":"VotingDefinitionId (UUID/GUID, required) - Identifies the specific voting instance, example: '9d80de02-11fb-4f79-80ee-181c0f92629d'. AgendaItemId (UUID/GUID, required) - Identifies the agenda item being voted on, example: '98BBFA75-F432-4BBB-9A10-202EFE7E2569'. LanguageId (integer, required) - Language identifier for localization, example: 1 (likely Macedonian). All parameters passed in JSON request body.","response_structure":"Empty response body received in this capture. Expected structure likely contains voting results data such as vote counts (for/against/abstain), individual MP votes, timestamps, quorum information, and voting outcome. Response format is application/json but this particular request returned no data, possibly indicating no voting results available for this specific combination of VotingDefinitionId and AgendaItemId, or the voting has not yet occurred.","documentation_notes":"This endpoint is part of the Sobranie (Parliament of North Macedonia) API routing system. Uses a generic POST routing mechanism at /Routing/MakePostRequest where the actual method name is specified in the request body 'MethodName' field. This pattern suggests a single-endpoint RPC-style API design. The endpoint retrieves voting results for specific agenda items in parliamentary sessions. The empty response may indicate: (1) voting hasn't occurred yet, (2) results are not yet published, (3) invalid ID combination, or (4) data has been removed/archived. The use of GUIDs suggests a modern database-backed system with proper unique identifiers for all entities.","other":"API Pattern: RPC-style routing through single endpoint. Base URL: https://www.sobranie.mk. GUID format used for both VotingDefinitionId and AgendaItemId suggests SQL Server or similar database backend. LanguageId=1 likely corresponds to Macedonian language (primary official language). The parliament website likely supports multiple languages. Related methods probably exist for: listing agenda items, getting voting definitions, retrieving session information, and accessing MP voting records. Security: No authentication headers observed in this request, suggesting public API access for transparency. Status 200 with empty body indicates successful request processing but no data returned rather than an error condition."}
