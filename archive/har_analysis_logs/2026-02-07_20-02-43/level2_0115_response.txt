{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetVotingResultsForSitting","parameters":"votingDefinitionId (string/UUID): Identifier for the voting definition (e.g., '18ba866e-e347-4e5a-8d8d-4d246402874b'); sittingId (string/UUID): Identifier for the parliamentary sitting (e.g., 'f06b995b-c5c7-42cd-8605-ec2d9ab7aac1'); languageId (integer): Language identifier for localization (1 = likely Macedonian or default language)","response_structure":"Empty response returned in this capture. Expected structure unknown but likely contains voting results data such as vote counts (for/against/abstain), individual MP votes, voting timestamp, quorum status, and vote outcome. May return empty array or null when no voting results are available for the specified sitting and voting definition combination.","documentation_notes":"This endpoint retrieves detailed voting results for a specific voting event within a parliamentary sitting. The generic routing mechanism at /Routing/MakePostRequest acts as a dispatcher that routes to different methods based on the MethodName parameter. This pattern suggests a single-endpoint RPC-style API rather than RESTful resource-based routing. The empty response in this capture may indicate: (1) voting has not yet occurred, (2) results are not yet published, (3) invalid ID combination, or (4) data has been removed/archived. The use of UUIDs for both votingDefinitionId and sittingId suggests a relational structure where multiple voting events can occur within a single sitting. LanguageId parameter indicates multi-language support in the API responses.","other":"Part of sobranie.mk (Assembly of North Macedonia) parliamentary information system. The generic POST routing pattern (/Routing/MakePostRequest) is unusual and suggests all API methods may use this same endpoint with MethodName discrimination. This makes API discovery challenging as endpoint paths don't reveal available methods. Related methods likely include: GetVotingDefinitionsForSitting, GetSittingDetails, GetMPVotingRecord. Security consideration: No authentication tokens visible in this request, suggesting public access to voting records. The votingDefinitionId and sittingId must be obtained from other API calls or UI interactions. Response sanitization note: actual response was empty, not redacted."}
