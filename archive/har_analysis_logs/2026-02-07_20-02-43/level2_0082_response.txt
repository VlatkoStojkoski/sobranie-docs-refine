{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body parameters. It appears to be a simple POST request with no payload.","response_structure":"Empty JSON response (status 200). The response body is empty, suggesting this endpoint may be used for side effects (like setting session state or cookies) rather than returning data, or it may return data in HTTP headers rather than the body.","documentation_notes":"This appears to be an infrastructure/utility endpoint for language management in the Sobranie (Parliament) system. The '/Infrastructure/' path prefix suggests it's part of the application's core functionality layer. The 'LoadLanguage' method name indicates it likely initializes or sets language preferences for the current session. Given the empty response body, this endpoint probably: (1) Sets language preference in session/cookies based on browser headers or previous user settings, (2) Returns language configuration via HTTP headers rather than body, or (3) Triggers server-side language loading without returning data to client. The POST method (rather than GET) suggests it may modify server state or session data.","other":"Notable characteristics: (1) Empty response body despite 200 success status, (2) No visible parameters but POST method used, (3) Part of Infrastructure namespace suggesting core system functionality, (4) May rely on cookies, session data, or HTTP headers (Accept-Language) for implicit parameters, (5) Likely called during application initialization or language switching, (6) May set response headers or cookies that weren't captured in the sanitized output."}
