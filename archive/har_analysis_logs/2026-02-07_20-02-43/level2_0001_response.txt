{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "None visible in request body or query string. This endpoint accepts POST with no apparent parameters in the captured request. May accept optional parameters for language selection (e.g., language code, locale identifier) that were not present in this specific call, or may rely on session/cookie data for language context.", "response_structure": "Empty JSON response in this capture. Status 200 indicates successful processing. The empty response suggests this may be a state-changing endpoint that sets language preferences server-side (possibly in session) without returning data, or this particular call resulted in no data due to default/already-set state.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure/LoadLanguage appears to be a language configuration endpoint for the Sobranie (Assembly) website. Purpose likely includes: (1) Setting user language preference for the session, (2) Loading language-specific resources or translations, (3) Initializing localization context. The empty response combined with 200 status suggests side-effect operation (session modification) rather than data retrieval. Common in multi-language government portals where language selection triggers backend state changes. May work in conjunction with cookie-based session management or Accept-Language headers.", "other": "Endpoint is under /Infrastructure path, indicating system-level or cross-cutting concern rather than domain-specific functionality. The empty response makes it difficult to determine exact behavior - could be: initialization endpoint called on page load, language switcher backend, or resource preloader. Recommend testing with various language codes as parameters (mk, en, sq, tr - common languages in North Macedonia) via query string, request body JSON, or headers to discover full API contract. Monitor Set-Cookie headers in response for session changes."}
