{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the backend method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): language identifier (1 observed, likely 1=Macedonian); Month (integer, required): month number 1-12; Year (integer, required): four-digit year (2026 tested)","response_structure":"Empty response received for future date (January 2026). Expected structure unknown but likely returns array of agenda items/sessions for the specified month when data exists. May include fields like date, session type, topics, or parliament meeting details. Response format is JSON.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that dispatches to different backend methods based on 'methodName' parameter. The MakePostRequest pattern suggests a multiplexer/proxy endpoint rather than RESTful design. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar data for a specific month and year. Empty response may indicate no scheduled sessions for January 2026 or the date is too far in future. Should test with current/past dates to understand actual response structure. LanguageId parameter suggests multilingual support.","other":"URL pattern /Routing/MakePostRequest indicates centralized request routing architecture. This differs from typical REST endpoints. Other potential methodName values should be discoverable through similar requests. The sobranie.mk domain is the Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia website. Consider testing with Month values 1-12, Year values for current/past years, and LanguageId values (likely 1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian, 3=English based on typical North Macedonia language support)."}
