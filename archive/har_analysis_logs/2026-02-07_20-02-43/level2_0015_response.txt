{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value 1 observed), 'Month' (integer, value 1 for January), 'Year' (integer, value 2026 observed). No query parameters. Endpoint follows ASMX web service pattern at path /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx/GetCustomEventsCalendar","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with 200 status code and application/json content-type. Expected structure unknown - may return calendar events array when data exists, or could be error condition masking as success. Typical ASMX services return wrapped objects with 'd' property containing actual data.","documentation_notes":"ASMX (ASP.NET XML Web Services) endpoint for retrieving custom calendar events from North Macedonia parliament system. Language parameter likely controls localization (1 may represent Macedonian or English). Month/Year parameters indicate date range filtering. Empty response suggests no events exist for January 2026, or the service encountered an issue but returned 200 anyway. The '/Moldova/' path segment is notable - may be legacy routing, CMS structure, or reference to historical naming. ASMX is legacy Microsoft technology, suggesting older system architecture.","other":"Service name 'CalendarService' suggests additional calendar-related methods may exist on same ASMX endpoint. Typical ASMX discovery via accessing .asmx URL directly or ?WSDL parameter. Related endpoints might include GetEvents, GetSessionCalendar, etc. The empty response with 200 status is concerning for API reliability - proper REST would return 204 No Content or structured empty array. Consider checking if future/past dates return data to validate functionality."}
