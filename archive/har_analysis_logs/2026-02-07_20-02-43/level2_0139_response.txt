{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. It appears to be a simple POST request without payload.","response_structure":"Empty response body with HTTP 200 status. Content-Type is application/json but the actual response contains no data. This suggests either: (1) the endpoint performs a side-effect operation without returning data, (2) it sets language preferences in session/cookies, or (3) the response was empty in this particular capture instance.","documentation_notes":"This is an Infrastructure namespace endpoint for language management on the Macedonian Parliament (sobranie.mk) website. The endpoint name 'LoadLanguage' suggests it initializes or switches language settings. Despite being a POST request, it requires no parameters, which is unusual. The empty response indicates this is likely a configuration/preference endpoint that updates server-side session state or returns language resources that may have been stripped during sanitization. The endpoint path '/Infrastructure/LoadLanguage' follows a typical ASP.NET MVC or Web API routing pattern. Without request body or meaningful response data in this capture, it's difficult to determine the exact functionality - it may load default language settings, retrieve language resource bundles, or initialize localization context for the user session.","other":"The endpoint uses POST method but has no request payload, which could indicate it relies on: (1) session cookies for user identification, (2) Accept-Language headers, (3) previous session state, or (4) default system configuration. The Infrastructure namespace suggests this is a utility/system endpoint rather than a business logic endpoint. Further investigation needed to determine if response was genuinely empty or if content was removed during HAR sanitization. This endpoint may be called automatically on page load or language selector interaction."}
