{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetVotingResultsForAgendaItemReportDocument","parameters":"MethodName (string, required): 'GetVotingResultsForAgendaItemReportDocument' - Specifies the backend method to invoke. LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier (1 appears to be default, likely Macedonian). VotingDefinitionId (string/UUID, required): Unique identifier for the voting definition (format: UUID with hyphens, e.g., '9d80de02-11fb-4f79-80ee-181c0f92629d'). AgendaItemId (string/UUID, required): Unique identifier for the agenda item (format: UUID with hyphens, uppercase, e.g., '98BBFA75-F432-4BBB-9A10-202EFE7E2569').","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (Status 200). This could indicate: (1) No voting results exist for the specified combination of VotingDefinitionId and AgendaItemId, (2) The document generation failed silently, (3) The method may trigger a background process or file generation, (4) The response might be a file download triggered via headers not visible in HAR body, or (5) Invalid/test request IDs were used. Expected response would likely be JSON containing voting results data or a document reference/URL for a report document.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that acts as an RPC-style gateway - the actual method invoked is determined by the MethodName parameter. The endpoint uses POST to /Routing/MakePostRequest for method dispatch. The method name suggests it retrieves voting results formatted for inclusion in a report document for a specific agenda item. The combination of VotingDefinitionId and AgendaItemId suggests a many-to-many relationship where multiple votings can occur on a single agenda item. Empty response may indicate the voting hasn't occurred yet, the IDs are invalid, or the document format is binary/downloadable. Language support is built into the API (LanguageId parameter).","other":"URL pattern suggests ASP.NET/MVC framework. The routing mechanism is RPC-style rather than RESTful. UUID formats are mixed case (lowercase with hyphens for VotingDefinitionId, uppercase with hyphens for AgendaItemId) which may indicate different database sources or legacy systems. The empty response with 200 status is unusual and warrants investigation - check response headers for Content-Disposition or file download indicators. This endpoint is part of the Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie) website's internal API for parliamentary voting and agenda management. Consider testing with known valid IDs from active sessions to verify expected response structure."}
