{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. Empty POST request body. No query string parameters. Appears to be a simple endpoint invocation without arguments.","response_structure":"Empty response body with 200 status code. Returns application/json content-type but body is empty, suggesting either an error condition, configuration where no language data is available, or the response sets language preference via cookies/headers rather than response body.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for loading language settings. Located under /Infrastructure namespace suggesting core system functionality. The empty response may indicate: (1) language preference is set server-side via session/cookie, (2) default language is already loaded, (3) missing language data, or (4) the endpoint triggers background language loading. This is likely part of the internationalization (i18n) infrastructure for the Sobranie (Parliament) website. May need to inspect response headers for Set-Cookie or other language preference indicators. Could be called during application initialization or language switching.","other":"Endpoint pattern suggests ASP.NET MVC or similar framework architecture with controller-based routing (Infrastructure controller, LoadLanguage action). The empty request/response pattern is unusual for a Load operation - typically would expect either language code parameter or language data in response. May require authentication/session context to function properly. Consider testing with different Accept-Language headers or checking if preceding requests establish session state."}
