{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. This endpoint accepts POST requests with no body content and no query string parameters. The request appears to rely on session/cookie state or server-side defaults to determine which language to load.","response_structure":"Returns empty response body with 200 OK status. The empty JSON response suggests this endpoint may be used for side effects (like setting session language preferences) rather than returning data, or the language data may be cached/set via other mechanisms (cookies, headers).","documentation_notes":"This is an infrastructure endpoint for language/localization management on the Macedonian Parliament website (sobranie.mk). The endpoint name 'LoadLanguage' suggests it handles language preference loading or switching. The empty response combined with successful 200 status indicates this is likely a state-setting operation that stores the language preference server-side (session) or client-side (via Set-Cookie headers not visible in response body). The Infrastructure namespace suggests this is part of the site's core framework rather than domain-specific business logic. Possible use cases: initializing default language, confirming language selection, or synchronizing language state.","other":"Endpoint belongs to Infrastructure namespace/controller, indicating framework-level functionality. No authentication tokens visible in sanitized request. The empty request body and empty response body pattern is unusual but suggests this might be: (1) a keepalive/ping endpoint that validates language settings, (2) an endpoint that triggers server-side language loading into cache, (3) a legacy endpoint that has been deprecated but remains for backward compatibility, or (4) an endpoint whose actual functionality depends on HTTP headers (Accept-Language, cookies) not captured in the body. Consider checking response headers for Set-Cookie or Content-Language directives."}
