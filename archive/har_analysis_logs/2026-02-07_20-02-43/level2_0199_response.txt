{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"Request body (JSON): {\"model\": {\"Language\": integer (1=likely Macedonian or primary language), \"Month\": integer (1-12, calendar month), \"Year\": integer (4-digit year, e.g. 2026)}}. All three fields appear to be required within the model object. Language appears to be an enumeration where 1 represents a specific language choice. Month and Year define the calendar period to retrieve events for.","response_structure":"Expected: JSON array or object containing calendar events. Actual response in this capture: empty (possibly no events scheduled for January 2026, or the year 2026 is out of range for available data). When populated, likely returns event objects with properties such as event title, date, description, type, or other calendar-related metadata.","documentation_notes":"This is a SOAP/ASMX web service endpoint converted to JSON (indicated by .asmx extension with JSON request/response). The endpoint belongs to CalendarService and retrieves custom calendar events for the Sobranie (Parliament) of North Macedonia. The 'Custom' in the method name suggests these are special parliamentary events distinct from regular sessions. The service is located under /Moldova/ path which likely refers to the Moldova district or the address of the parliament building. Empty response for January 2026 suggests either no events are scheduled that far in advance, the system doesn't have future data loaded, or there's a validation issue with future dates. Testing with current/recent dates would confirm functionality.","other":"Base service path: /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx. Service type: ASP.NET ASMX Web Service with JSON serialization. Domain: www.sobranie.mk (Parliament of North Macedonia official website). The request structure follows typical ASMX JSON pattern with model wrapper. Consider testing with Language values 0, 1, 2 to determine language options (likely Macedonian, Albanian, English). Month values should be validated 1-12. Year range should be tested to determine valid historical and future bounds. Related endpoints likely exist: GetEventsCalendar, GetSessionCalendar, or similar variants without 'Custom' prefix."}
