{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "None - This endpoint accepts POST requests with no query parameters or request body. It may rely on session cookies, headers (like Accept-Language), or server-side user preferences to determine which language to load.", "response_structure": "Empty response body with 200 OK status. This suggests the endpoint may: (1) set language preferences server-side via session/cookies without returning data, (2) return an empty result when no language change is needed, or (3) be called for side effects only (setting session state). Expected response is JSON format based on Content-Type header, but actual payload is empty.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language management on the Macedonian Parliament (sobranie.mk) website. The '/Infrastructure/' path prefix suggests this is a system/utility endpoint rather than a data retrieval endpoint. The method name 'LoadLanguage' implies it loads or sets language preferences for the current user session. The empty response with successful status indicates this is likely a state-changing operation that doesn't return confirmation data. This endpoint probably works in conjunction with other language-related endpoints or relies on subsequent page requests to reflect the language change. May be called via AJAX when users switch languages in the UI.", "other": "Observations: (1) POST method for what appears to be a configuration operation is appropriate for state changes. (2) Empty request/response pattern suggests lightweight session management. (3) The endpoint may be idempotent despite using POST. (4) Without request parameters visible, the language selection mechanism is unclear - could be determined by Referer header, cookie values, or default server logic. (5) This endpoint likely requires an active session to function properly. (6) May need to examine related endpoints or browser state (cookies, localStorage) to understand the complete language switching mechanism."}
