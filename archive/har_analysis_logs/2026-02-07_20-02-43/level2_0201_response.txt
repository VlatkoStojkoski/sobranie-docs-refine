{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "GetAllStructuresForFilter", "parameters": "methodName (string, required): The backend method to invoke, value 'GetAllStructuresForFilter'. languageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization, value 1 likely represents Macedonian language. Request is sent to generic routing endpoint /Routing/MakePostRequest which acts as a dispatcher/proxy.", "response_structure": "Empty response returned in this capture. Expected structure unknown but method name suggests it should return a list or collection of organizational structures used for filtering purposes (parliamentary bodies, committees, working groups, etc.). Likely returns JSON array or object with structure metadata.", "documentation_notes": "This is a generic RPC-style routing mechanism where all API calls go through /Routing/MakePostRequest endpoint. The actual method invoked is specified in the POST body via 'methodName' parameter. GetAllStructuresForFilter appears to retrieve organizational/parliamentary structures for UI filtering components. The empty response may indicate no data available, an error condition, or incomplete capture. This pattern suggests a backend service dispatcher architecture rather than RESTful endpoints.", "other": "API uses POST-based RPC pattern instead of REST conventions. All requests route through single endpoint making discovery difficult without method name enumeration. languageId parameter suggests multilingual support (1=Macedonian, possibly 2=Albanian based on North Macedonia's official languages). Method naming convention uses PascalCase. This endpoint likely populates dropdown filters or navigation elements in the parliamentary website UI. Consider testing with different languageId values and checking for similar GetAll* methods."}
