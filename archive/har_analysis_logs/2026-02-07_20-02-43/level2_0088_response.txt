{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the backend method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): 1 for primary language (likely Macedonian), potentially other values for Albanian or English; Month (integer, required): 1-12 representing calendar month; Year (integer, required): four-digit year value (e.g., 2026)","response_structure":"Empty response received for January 2026 query, suggesting either no agenda items exist for future dates, the endpoint filters out future events, or data is not yet populated. Expected structure likely array of agenda items with properties such as date, time, title, description, session type, and participants when data is available. Content-Type indicates JSON format.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST router endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that dispatches to different backend methods based on the 'methodName' parameter. This pattern suggests multiple similar methods may be accessible through this same route (e.g., GetWeeklyAgenda, GetDailyAgenda, GetYearlyAgenda). The empty response for a future date (January 2026) may indicate the endpoint only returns historical or current data, or that parliamentary agenda is not scheduled that far in advance. Test with current/past dates to verify expected response structure. The endpoint appears to retrieve parliamentary session schedules and agenda items for the North Macedonian Parliament.","other":"Domain sobranie.mk is the official website of the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia. The routing pattern using a generic MakePostRequest endpoint with methodName parameter is unusual but allows for a flexible API structure. Future testing should explore: (1) different methodName values for agenda retrieval, (2) current month/year combinations to observe populated responses, (3) other LanguageId values (likely 2 for Albanian, possibly 3 for English), (4) boundary testing for Month (0, 13) and Year values, (5) whether authentication affects available data ranges."}
