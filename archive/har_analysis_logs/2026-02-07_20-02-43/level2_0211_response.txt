{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value 1 observed), 'Month' (integer, value 1 for January), 'Year' (integer, value 2026 observed). Language appears to be an enum where 1 likely represents a specific language option (possibly Macedonian or Albanian based on domain). Month uses 1-based indexing (1=January). Year is a 4-digit integer for the calendar year requested.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned in this capture (status 200). Expected structure likely JSON array or object containing calendar events for the specified month/year, but no events exist for January 2026 or the service returned empty legitimately. Normal responses would likely contain event objects with properties such as date, title, description, event type, etc.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint for retrieving custom calendar events from the Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie) website. Service located at /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx suggesting legacy ASP.NET Web Services architecture. The 'Moldova' path segment appears unusual for a Macedonian parliament site - may indicate localization structure or naming convention. Method retrieves filtered calendar events based on language preference, specific month, and year. Empty response suggests either no events scheduled for January 2026 or successful request with no matching data. Content-Type is application/json despite ASMX traditionally using XML, indicating JSON serialization is enabled.","other":"Domain sobranie.mk is the official Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia website. The Language parameter set to 1 needs mapping documentation to determine which language it represents (Macedonian and Albanian are official languages). Service may have additional methods in CalendarService.asmx not captured here. Future testing should include different month/year combinations with known events, different Language values (0, 2, etc.), and exploring the parent ASMX endpoint for WSDL documentation. The POST request to an ASMX endpoint with JSON is non-standard and suggests custom configuration or wrapper implementation."}
