{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "GetAllStructuresForFilter", "parameters": "methodName (string, required): The API method to invoke, value 'GetAllStructuresForFilter'; languageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization, value 1 represents a specific language (likely Macedonian as primary language)", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned with HTTP 200 status. This could indicate: (1) No structures exist in the system, (2) The method executes successfully but returns no data for the given language, (3) The response format may vary or be conditional, (4) Possible error condition that returns empty rather than error message", "documentation_notes": "This is a generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a proxy/dispatcher for multiple backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. The method 'GetAllStructuresForFilter' suggests it retrieves organizational or governmental structures that can be used for filtering other data. The empty response in this capture may indicate either no data availability or that this is a setup/initialization call. This pattern suggests a single-endpoint architecture where all API methods route through one URL.", "other": "The endpoint name 'MakePostRequest' is unusual and suggests a generic RPC-style interface rather than RESTful design. The sobranie.mk domain indicates this is the official website of the Assembly of North Macedonia (parliament). 'Structures' likely refers to parliamentary structures such as committees, working bodies, or organizational units. The languageId parameter suggests multilingual support. This endpoint pattern may be used for multiple different method calls throughout the application, making it a key discovery point for further API exploration. To discover other methods, monitor this endpoint for different methodName values. The empty response suggests this might be called during page initialization or filter setup."}
