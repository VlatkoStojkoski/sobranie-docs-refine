{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters in URL query string or request body. Likely accepts language preference via cookies, session data, or HTTP headers (e.g., Accept-Language). May also accept parameters in request body that were not captured or sanitized.", "response_structure": "Empty response body (200 OK status). This suggests the endpoint may: (1) set language preference in server-side session/cookies without returning data, (2) return empty response on successful preference update, or (3) the response was empty in this specific capture due to session state.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language loading/switching on the Macedonian Parliament website (sobranie.mk). Located under /Infrastructure/ path suggesting internal/utility functionality. POST method indicates state-changing operation (setting language preference) rather than retrieval. The endpoint name 'LoadLanguage' is somewhat ambiguous - could mean loading language resources server-side or setting user's language preference. Given the empty response, most likely sets session language preference and returns success status without body. Typical usage would involve language code parameter (e.g., 'mk' for Macedonian, 'en' for English, 'al' for Albanian which are common languages in North Macedonia).", "other": "Part of infrastructure/utility API group rather than content API. Related endpoints likely exist for other infrastructure operations. May be called during page load or language switcher interaction. Empty response with 200 status is unusual but valid REST pattern for acknowledgment-only operations. Consider testing with different language codes in body/headers to determine actual parameter structure. Session/cookie inspection would reveal if language preference is stored client-side."}
