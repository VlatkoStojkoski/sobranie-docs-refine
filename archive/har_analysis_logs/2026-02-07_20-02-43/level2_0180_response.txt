{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. POST request to /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage with no query string parameters and no request body.","response_structure":"Returns HTTP 200 with application/json content-type. Response body is empty, suggesting either: (1) language data is set server-side via session/cookie, (2) returns empty when language is already loaded, or (3) minimal/null JSON response indicating success.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for loading language resources. Part of the localization/internationalization system. The empty response suggests this may be a state-changing operation (setting server-side session language preference) rather than a data retrieval endpoint. May need to examine response headers for Set-Cookie or other session indicators. Could be called on page load or language selection events to initialize/switch the UI language context.","other":"Endpoint location under /Infrastructure path suggests internal application plumbing rather than public-facing API. Empty response with 200 status is unusual - typical patterns would return language data, confirmation message, or status indicator. May require authentication/session context to function properly. Consider testing with different Accept-Language headers or checking if prior authentication endpoints set language context. Response might populate application state on client-side via side effects rather than explicit data return."}
