{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No request parameters, query strings, or request body. This is a POST request but appears to send no data. Likely relies on session cookies or authentication headers to determine user context and language preference.", "response_structure": "Empty JSON response. Status 200 indicates success but no data is returned in the body. The endpoint may be setting server-side session state or cookies rather than returning data. Expected response is an empty JSON object or null.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for loading or setting language preferences. Part of the /Infrastructure namespace suggesting core system functionality. The empty response suggests this is a state-setting operation rather than data retrieval. May be called during session initialization or language switching. The endpoint likely reads authentication/session context to determine which language to load and stores this preference server-side. No validation errors despite empty request body indicates either no parameters are required or the endpoint gracefully handles missing data. This appears to be a utility endpoint that configures the user session rather than returning language data directly - actual translated content would be served through other endpoints.", "other": "Endpoint naming suggests internationalization/localization infrastructure. The empty response is unusual for a Load operation - typically Load operations return data. This may actually be a session configuration endpoint that triggers language preference storage. Could be part of a two-step process where language selection is POST-ed here and subsequent requests receive localized content. May set cookies or modify session state on the server. The sobranie.mk domain (Macedonian Parliament) likely supports multiple languages including Macedonian, Albanian, and English. Further investigation needed to understand the complete language switching mechanism and whether language selection is passed via headers, cookies, or requires a different endpoint variant."}
