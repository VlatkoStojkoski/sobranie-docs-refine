{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the backend method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): 1 for primary language (likely Macedonian), possibly 2 for secondary (Albanian or English); Month (integer, required): numeric month value 1-12, represents target month for agenda retrieval; Year (integer, required): four-digit year value, tested with 2026 indicating future date support","response_structure":"Empty response returned for test query (January 2026). Expected structure likely array of agenda items with properties such as date, time, title, description, session type, participants when data exists. Response format appears to be JSON based on content-type header.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that dispatches to different backend methods based on methodName parameter. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar for specified month and year. Empty response for January 2026 suggests no scheduled events in future dates or data not yet populated. The endpoint follows RPC-style pattern rather than RESTful design. LanguageId parameter indicates multilingual support for North Macedonia's official languages. This method likely powers calendar/agenda views on the parliamentary website showing scheduled sessions, meetings, and events.","other":"URL pattern /Routing/MakePostRequest indicates centralized RPC gateway. Other methodName values likely exist for different data retrieval operations (sessions, votes, deputies, legislation, etc). Future testing should include current/past dates to observe populated responses, test LanguageId variations (1,2), and boundary conditions for Month (1-12) and Year parameters. Authentication appears unnecessary for this public data endpoint. Consider testing invalid methodName values to discover available methods or error responses."}
