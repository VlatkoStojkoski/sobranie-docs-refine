{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. This endpoint accepts a POST request with no query parameters and no request body. The language context may be determined from session state, cookies, or Accept-Language headers rather than explicit parameters.","response_structure":"Empty response body with 200 OK status. The endpoint appears to return successfully but with no content, suggesting it may be performing a server-side operation (like loading language resources into session) without returning data to the client, or the response may be handled differently in the application context.","documentation_notes":"This is an infrastructure endpoint for the Sobranie (Parliament) of North Macedonia website. The LoadLanguage endpoint appears to be part of the site's internationalization/localization system. Given the empty response and POST method, this likely initializes or loads language resources on the server side, possibly setting session preferences or preloading translation resources. The endpoint may rely on implicit context (cookies, session state, or HTTP headers) to determine which language to load. The empty response suggests this is a fire-and-forget operation or that the actual language data is loaded into server-side session rather than returned to the client.","other":"Base path: /Infrastructure/ suggests this is part of a common infrastructure module handling cross-cutting concerns. The empty response with 200 status could indicate: (1) language data loaded into server session, (2) this is a keepalive or initialization endpoint, (3) the actual response handling happens via other mechanisms like Set-Cookie headers that weren't captured. Without additional context about cookies, session headers, or subsequent requests, the full purpose is unclear. This endpoint may be called during page initialization or language switching operations on the sobranie.mk website."}
