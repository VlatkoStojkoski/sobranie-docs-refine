{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value 1 observed), 'Month' (integer, value 1 observed for January), 'Year' (integer, value 2026 observed). All three fields appear required for the calendar query.","response_structure":"Empty response returned for the test query (2026-01). Likely returns JSON array or object with calendar events when data exists. Expected structure unknown but probably contains event details like date, title, description for parliamentary calendar activities.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint for Macedonian Parliament (sobranie.mk) calendar system. Service path indicates Moldova subdirectory which may be site structure artifact. Language parameter uses numeric codes (1 observed, likely Macedonian or English). Month uses standard 1-12 numbering. The service retrieves custom/special events for parliamentary calendar. Empty response suggests no events scheduled for January 2026 or future dates not yet populated in system.","other":"Service uses legacy ASP.NET Web Services (ASMX) technology rather than modern REST API. Content-Type is application/json despite ASMX typically using XML. The 'Custom' in method name suggests there may be other calendar endpoints (regular events, sessions, etc). Future date query (2026) returned empty, indicating calendar may only contain past/current data or requires different parameters for future planning."}
