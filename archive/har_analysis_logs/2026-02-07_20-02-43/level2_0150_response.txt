{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): The RPC-style method to invoke, value 'GetMonthlyAgenda'. LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier, value 1 observed (likely Macedonian). Month (integer, required): Month number 1-12, value 1 observed (January). Year (integer, required): Four-digit year, value 2026 observed for future date query.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with 200 status. Expected structure unknown - may return array of agenda items with date, time, title, description fields when data exists, or may indicate no events scheduled for requested month/year combination. Likely returns JSON array or object when populated.","documentation_notes":"RPC-style routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that dispatches to different methods based on methodName parameter. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar events for specified month and year. Empty response for January 2026 suggests either no events scheduled or future dates return empty. Testing with current/past dates recommended to determine actual response structure. LanguageId=1 appears to be Macedonian language based on .mk domain (North Macedonia Parliament website).","other":"Endpoint uses generic router pattern common in .NET/MVC applications. Single POST endpoint handles multiple methods via methodName discrimination. Future date query (2026) returned empty - behavior with historical dates unknown. Consider testing Month values 1-12, current year, and LanguageId variations (likely 1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian based on North Macedonia's bilingual requirements). May be part of larger calendar/scheduling system for parliamentary sessions, committee meetings, and legislative activities."}
