{"route_type": "Static Resource", "method_name": "get_agenda_item_votings_html", "parameters": "None - This is a static HTML file request with no query parameters or request body. The path suggests it may be a template or component file related to displaying voting information for agenda items.", "response_structure": "Content-Type: text/html, Status: 200. Response body is empty, which suggests this could be: (1) A template file loaded client-side via JavaScript, (2) A placeholder or deleted resource, (3) An intentionally empty HTML fragment used as a component. The empty response with 200 status is unusual for a typical HTML page.", "documentation_notes": "This appears to be part of the Moldova module within the sobranie.mk (North Macedonian Parliament) website. The path structure '/Scripts/Moldova/agenda-item-votings/' suggests this is a client-side resource, possibly an Angular, React, or other SPA framework template. The 'agenda-item-votings' naming indicates functionality related to displaying or managing votes on parliamentary agenda items. Despite being served as text/html, the empty response suggests it's either: (a) a dynamic template populated by JavaScript, (b) a deprecated endpoint, or (c) requires authentication/session that wasn't provided. This is NOT a REST API endpoint but rather a frontend resource file.", "other": "Investigation recommendations: (1) Check if this file is referenced in JavaScript bundle files or main application code, (2) Look for API endpoints that actually serve voting data (likely JSON format under /api/ or similar paths), (3) Examine network requests made by the page that loads this resource to find the actual data endpoints, (4) The 'Moldova' path segment is interesting - may indicate multi-tenant architecture or historical naming (Moldova vs North Macedonia). This static resource likely works in conjunction with actual API endpoints that serve voting data in JSON format."}
