{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with model object containing: Language (integer, value 1 observed), Month (integer, 1-12 range, value 1 observed for January), Year (integer, value 2026 observed). All three parameters appear required as part of nested model object.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with 200 status and application/json content-type. For the test case (January 2026), no events were present. Expected structure likely JSON array or object containing calendar events when data exists, but actual structure unknown from this empty response.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint for Moldova parliament calendar system. Service follows ASMX/SOAP convention but uses JSON for data exchange. The GetCustomEventsCalendar method retrieves custom events for a specific month and year in specified language. Language parameter 1 likely represents Macedonian or primary language. Empty response suggests either no events scheduled for January 2026, or request parameters were out of valid range. Service path indicates Moldova-specific implementation within sobranie.mk (North Macedonia Parliament website).","other":"Endpoint uses legacy ASMX web service technology. Path structure '/Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx/' suggests multiple service modules may exist. The 2026 year in test data indicates forward-looking calendar functionality. Consider testing with current/past dates to observe populated response structure. Language parameter enumeration unknown - test values 0, 2, 3 etc to discover supported languages. Month boundaries (0, 13) and Year limits should be validated."}
