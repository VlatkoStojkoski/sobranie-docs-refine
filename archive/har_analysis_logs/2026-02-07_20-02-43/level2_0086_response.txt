{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "GetMaterialDetails", "parameters": "MaterialId (string/UUID, required): Unique identifier for the material being requested (e.g., 'e1a80865-4452-46b5-ae20-fab17630cd60'); LanguageId (integer, required): Language selection for response content, value 1 likely represents Macedonian or default language; AmendmentsPage (integer, required): Pagination parameter for amendments, starts at 1; AmendmentsRows (integer, required): Number of amendment rows per page, set to 5 in this example", "response_structure": "Status 200 with application/json content type. Response body appears empty in this capture, which may indicate: no data available for the requested MaterialId, error condition not properly communicated, or data was present but sanitized/removed. Expected structure likely contains material details including title, description, status, dates, and paginated amendments list based on the request parameters.", "documentation_notes": "This endpoint uses a generic routing pattern (/Routing/MakePostRequest) where the actual API method is specified in the request body via 'methodName' field rather than the URL path. This is a non-RESTful RPC-style architecture. The GetMaterialDetails method retrieves details about parliamentary materials (likely bills, proposals, or legislative documents) with support for multi-language content and paginated amendments. The empty response suggests either the material doesn't exist, has no amendments, or there was an error that wasn't properly returned. The UUID format for MaterialId indicates a GUID-based identification system for materials in the database.", "other": "This is part of the sobranie.mk (Assembly of North Macedonia) parliamentary system API. The generic /Routing/MakePostRequest endpoint acts as a dispatcher/router for multiple backend methods, making API discovery more difficult as all methods share the same URL. Other potential methodName values should be investigated. The pagination parameters (AmendmentsPage, AmendmentsRows) suggest amendments are a significant component of material details. LanguageId=1 should be tested against other values (likely 2 for Albanian, given North Macedonia's bilingual requirements). The empty response warrants further investigation with known valid MaterialIds to understand the proper response structure."}
