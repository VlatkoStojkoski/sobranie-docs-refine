{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. It appears to be a state-based endpoint that likely relies on session/cookie data or server-side context to determine which language configuration to load.","response_structure":"Empty response body. Status 200 indicates success, but no data is returned in the response. This suggests the endpoint may be setting server-side session state, cookies, or triggering a cache update rather than returning language data directly.","documentation_notes":"This is an Infrastructure utility endpoint for loading language settings. The endpoint name suggests it initializes or loads language configuration for the application. Given the empty response with 200 status, this likely performs a server-side operation such as: (1) Setting language preference in session storage, (2) Initializing language resources in server cache, (3) Validating language availability, or (4) Triggering language pack loading. The actual language selection may be determined by Accept-Language headers, cookies, or prior authentication context. This endpoint appears to be part of the internationalization (i18n) infrastructure for the Sobranie (Parliament) website. To fully understand this endpoint, check: request headers for Accept-Language or custom language headers, response headers for Set-Cookie directives, and whether subsequent requests return content in a specific language.","other":"Category: Infrastructure/Utility. Pattern: State management endpoint with side effects but no direct response payload. Common in systems where language preferences are managed server-side. The /Infrastructure namespace suggests this is part of the application's core plumbing rather than business logic. May be called during application initialization, user login, or language switching actions. Testing recommendation: Monitor cookies and session state changes when calling this endpoint, and verify if subsequent API calls return localized content."}
