{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the remote method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): language identifier (1 observed, likely Macedonian or English); Month (integer, required): month number 1-12 (value 1 observed for January); Year (integer, required): four-digit year (2026 observed in test request)","response_structure":"Empty response returned for the test request (likely because January 2026 has no scheduled agenda items). Expected structure when data exists would likely be an array of agenda items with fields such as date, title, description, session type, and related metadata. Response format appears to be JSON based on Content-Type header.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that acts as an RPC-style gateway to multiple backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the POST body. This specific method retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar data for a given month and year. The empty response for a future date (2026) suggests the system has no scheduled items that far ahead, or only returns data for months with actual events. To discover available agenda items, try querying current or recent months. The LanguageId parameter suggests the API supports multiple languages for returned content.","other":"The endpoint pattern /Routing/MakePostRequest suggests this is a centralized dispatcher for multiple API methods rather than RESTful resource-based routing. This architecture implies there may be many other methodName values available (e.g., GetDailyAgenda, GetWeeklyAgenda, GetSessionDetails, etc.). To discover additional methods, inspect other HAR requests or look for client-side JavaScript that constructs these requests. The response being empty rather than an error suggests the request was valid but returned no data, indicating this is likely production-ready functionality. Future API exploration should focus on: testing different Month/Year combinations (especially current/past dates), trying different LanguageId values, and identifying other methodName options through additional HAR analysis or frontend code inspection."}
