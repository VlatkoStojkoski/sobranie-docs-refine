{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllMPsClubsByStructure","parameters":"MethodName (string, required): 'GetAllMPsClubsByStructure' - specifies the API method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): 1 - language identifier for localization (1 appears to be Macedonian); StructureId (string, required): UUID format (e.g., '5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473') - identifies a specific parliamentary structure/organization","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (status 200). This may indicate: no MPs/clubs found for the given structure, data retrieval issue, or the structure ID may be invalid/expired. Expected response would likely be JSON array of MP objects with club/party affiliations organized by parliamentary structure","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a dispatcher for multiple API methods. The actual method is specified via the MethodName parameter. This method retrieves Members of Parliament (MPs) and their parliamentary clubs/groups filtered by a specific structure ID. The empty response suggests either the structure has no associated MPs, the structure ID is invalid, or there may be authorization/data access issues. The sobranie.mk domain indicates this is the Macedonian Parliament's API","other":"This appears to be part of a dynamic routing architecture where a single POST endpoint handles multiple API methods via the MethodName parameter. Other discovered methods should follow the same request pattern to this endpoint. The StructureId likely corresponds to parliamentary terms, committees, or organizational structures within the Macedonian Assembly. Consider testing with different StructureIds and LanguageIds to map available data. The empty response may warrant investigation with valid/current structure IDs"}
