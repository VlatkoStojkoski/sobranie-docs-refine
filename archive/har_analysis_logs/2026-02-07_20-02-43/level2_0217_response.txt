{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. Endpoint accepts POST request with empty body. No query string parameters, no JSON payload, no form data.","response_structure":"Empty response body. HTTP 200 status indicates successful execution. Returns application/json content-type but body contains no data (empty string or zero bytes).","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language loading functionality. Part of the /Infrastructure namespace which suggests core application configuration or setup operations. The endpoint appears to perform a server-side action (loading language resources) without returning data to the client. This is likely a trigger endpoint that initializes or refreshes language resources on the server side, possibly updating session state, cache, or internal application configuration. The empty response suggests fire-and-forget pattern or that language data is loaded into session/context rather than returned directly. May be called during application initialization, language switching, or session setup. Client should only check for 200 status to confirm successful execution.","other":"Endpoint belongs to Infrastructure namespace suggesting system-level operations. No authentication or authorization headers visible in sanitized request. The empty request/response pattern indicates this might be idempotent and safe to retry. Could be part of initialization sequence for new sessions or language preference changes. The POST method suggests state-changing operation on server despite empty response. May trigger server-side caching, database queries, or resource loading without client-visible output."}
