{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllPoliticalParties","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetAllPoliticalParties' - specifies the backend method to invoke; languageId (integer, required): 1 - language identifier for localization (likely 1=Macedonian); StructureId (string, required): '5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473' - UUID format identifier, possibly references legislative structure/session/term","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with 200 status. Expected structure unknown - may return array of political party objects with fields like party ID, name, acronym, seats, logo URL, description when data exists. Empty response could indicate no parties in specified structure or data access issue.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint that acts as an RPC gateway - the actual method is specified in the request body via 'methodName' parameter rather than URL path. The endpoint pattern '/Routing/MakePostRequest' suggests a centralized router handling multiple backend methods. The StructureId UUID likely corresponds to a specific parliamentary structure/composition period. Response was empty which is unusual for 'GetAll' method - may need different StructureId or this structure has no associated parties. Language ID suggests multi-language support across the API.","other":"API uses RPC-style architecture over REST. All requests likely go through this single POST endpoint with method specified in body. The empty response with 200 status (not 404) suggests successful request but no data, possibly because StructureId references invalid/empty structure. Other potential methodName values might include GetAllMPs, GetAllCommittees, GetAllSessions, etc. Consider testing with different StructureId values or omitting it.
