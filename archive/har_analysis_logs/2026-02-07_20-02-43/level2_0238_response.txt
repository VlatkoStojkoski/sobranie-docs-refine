{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body parameters. It appears to be a simple POST request without payload.","response_structure":"Empty response body (200 OK status). The response is application/json content-type but contains no data, suggesting either an error condition, initialization endpoint, or the actual data may be loaded via side effects (cookies, session, etc.).","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language loading functionality. Path structure suggests this is part of a modular infrastructure system (/Infrastructure/*). The empty response despite successful 200 status indicates this may be: (1) a session/cookie-based language preference setter that stores data server-side, (2) a cache warming endpoint, (3) an initialization trigger, or (4) the response may have been empty in this specific capture but normally returns data. The POST method without body parameters is unusual and suggests the language selection may be determined by session state, headers (Accept-Language), or previously set preferences rather than explicit parameters.","other":"Endpoint belongs to the Parliament of North Macedonia website (sobranie.mk). The naming convention 'LoadLanguage' suggests this loads or initializes language resources, possibly for localization/internationalization. Given the website likely supports Macedonian, Albanian, and English, this endpoint may be retrieving language packs or setting language context. The empty response in this capture may indicate the language was already loaded or cached. Future analysis should check for: Set-Cookie headers, Accept-Language request headers, referer patterns, and whether subsequent requests show different language content."}
