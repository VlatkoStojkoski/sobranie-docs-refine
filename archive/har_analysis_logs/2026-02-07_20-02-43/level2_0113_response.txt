{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value 1 observed), 'Month' (integer, value 1 observed for January), 'Year' (integer, value 2026 observed). Parameters appear to filter calendar events by language preference, specific month, and year.","response_structure":"Empty response observed (possibly no events for the requested period: January 2026). Expected structure likely JSON array or object containing calendar events when data exists. Content-Type is application/json.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services). Part of CalendarService for Sobranie (Macedonian Parliament). The 'GetCustomEventsCalendar' method retrieves parliamentary calendar events filtered by language, month, and year. Language=1 likely represents Macedonian (primary language). Empty response for January 2026 suggests either no scheduled events or the query is for a future date beyond available data. Service located under '/Moldova/services/' path which may indicate organizational structure or legacy naming.","other":"This is a legacy ASMX (ASP.NET XML Web Services) endpoint, identifiable by the .asmx extension. The '/Moldova/' path segment is notable and may be a configuration artifact or organizational naming convention. The service accepts POST requests with JSON payload despite being ASMX (which traditionally used SOAP/XML). The response being empty for a future date (2026) is expected behavior. To discover available events, queries should target current or past dates. Language parameter suggests multi-language support for the parliamentary system."}
