{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetPoliticalPartyDetails","parameters":"politicalPartyId (UUID/GUID format, required) - Identifier for the political party (e.g., '4c57e5ab-2bc1-4943-8ecd-bde1166cf829'); LanguageId (integer, required) - Language selection identifier, value 1 observed, likely corresponds to Macedonian or primary language; methodName (string, required) - Internal routing parameter specifying the target method","response_structure":"Empty response body observed in this capture. Expected structure unknown - may return political party details including name, description, members, logo, founding date, ideology, parliamentary representation, or contact information in JSON format when party ID is valid. Empty response could indicate: invalid party ID, party not found, or a soft-delete/inactive status.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a gateway/dispatcher for multiple backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' field in the request body. This pattern suggests a single-endpoint API architecture where all POST requests are routed through this handler. The sobranie.mk domain indicates this is the official website of the Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia. The UUID format for politicalPartyId suggests a stable, database-generated identifier system. LanguageId=1 likely represents Macedonian language, with other values potentially for Albanian, English, or other official/supported languages.","other":"URL pattern suggests ASP.NET MVC routing convention. The empty response may warrant investigation - could be a test request, expired party ID, or error condition without proper error messaging. For complete API discovery, should test: different LanguageId values (0, 2, 3), valid party IDs from active parties, invalid/malformed UUIDs, missing parameters. The generic routing endpoint likely handles multiple methodName values beyond GetPoliticalPartyDetails - other methods may include GetMPs, GetLegislation, GetSessions, etc. Consider checking network tab for similar requests with different methodName values to map the complete internal API surface."}
