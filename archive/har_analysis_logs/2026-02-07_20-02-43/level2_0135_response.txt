{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization (observed value: 1). Month (integer, required): Month number 1-12 (observed value: 1 for January). Year (integer, required): Four-digit year (observed value: 2026).","response_structure":"Empty array or object returned when no agenda items exist for the specified month/year. Expected structure likely contains agenda/calendar events when data is present, possibly array of objects with date, event type, session details, or meeting information.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint that dispatches to different methods based on methodName parameter. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar for a specific month and year. The empty response for January 2026 suggests either no scheduled events or future dates return empty. LanguageId=1 likely represents Macedonian language. This appears to be part of a parliamentary calendar/scheduling system. To discover valid responses, try current or recent past months/years instead of future dates.","other":"Base URL: https://www.sobranie.mk. Routing pattern uses methodName field for method dispatch rather than distinct endpoints. Similar methods likely exist for weekly/daily agendas or other parliamentary data retrieval. Consider testing with Year: 2024 or 2025 and various Month values to see populated responses. The MakePostRequest endpoint appears to be a facade/dispatcher for multiple backend methods."}
