{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value 1 observed), 'Month' (integer, 1-12 range, value 1 observed for January), 'Year' (integer, value 2026 observed). No query parameters. Endpoint follows ASMX web service pattern at path /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx/","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with 200 status. Expected structure unknown - may return calendar events array when data exists, or this empty response may indicate no events for requested period (January 2026). Content-Type is application/json suggesting JSON response format when data present.","documentation_notes":"This is a legacy ASP.NET ASMX web service endpoint for retrieving custom calendar events. The Language parameter likely controls localization (1 may represent Macedonian or default language). The service is located under /Moldova/ path suggesting parliamentary/legislative calendar functionality for North Macedonia's Sobranie (Assembly). Empty response for future date (2026) suggests either no events scheduled or API only returns data for valid historical/current periods. The model wrapper pattern is typical for ASMX JSON endpoints.","other":"Service naming suggests CalendarService.asmx is the web service with multiple methods. Future months/years may intentionally return empty. Consider testing with current/past dates to see actual response structure. Language parameter suggests multi-language support - test with different values (0, 2, etc). This appears to be part of a larger parliamentary information system for the Assembly of North Macedonia."}
