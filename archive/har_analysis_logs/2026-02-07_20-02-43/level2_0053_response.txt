{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "GetAllStructuresForFilter", "parameters": "methodName (string, required): The RPC-style method name to invoke, value 'GetAllStructuresForFilter'. languageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization, value 1 observed (likely Macedonian as primary language).", "response_structure": "Empty response body observed in this capture. Expected structure unknown - may return array of structure objects for filtering purposes, or could indicate no data available, authentication required, or error condition. Typical structure data might include parliamentary structures, committees, or organizational hierarchies with fields like id, name, description, type.", "documentation_notes": "This is an RPC-style gateway endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that routes to different backend methods based on the methodName parameter. GetAllStructuresForFilter suggests retrieving structural/organizational data for filtering UI components. The empty response may indicate: (1) no structures currently defined, (2) missing authentication/session, (3) the method requires additional parameters not provided, or (4) data initialization issue. The languageId parameter indicates multi-language support in the Parliament of North Macedonia website. This pattern suggests a centralized routing mechanism where all API calls go through this single endpoint rather than RESTful resource-based URLs.", "other": "API Design Pattern: RPC/Gateway pattern rather than REST. The actual endpoint logic is determined by methodName parameter. This is common in legacy .NET applications or systems migrated from SOAP services. Testing recommendations: (1) Try with valid session/authentication tokens, (2) Test with languageId values 2, 3 for other languages (likely Albanian, English), (3) Investigate if additional filter parameters are needed in request body, (4) Check browser network tab during normal site usage to see successful responses. Related endpoints likely exist with similar structure using different methodName values for other parliamentary data operations."}
