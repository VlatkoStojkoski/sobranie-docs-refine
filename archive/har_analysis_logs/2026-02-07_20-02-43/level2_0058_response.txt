Status: 200 OK","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services). Retrieves custom events for parliamentary calendar by month/year. Language parameter suggests multi-language support. The empty response for January 2026 indicates either: (1) no events scheduled that far in future, (2) calendar data not yet populated, or (3) the endpoint filters out future dates beyond certain threshold. Testing with current/past dates recommended to observe populated response structure.","other":"Service path structure: /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx/* suggests this is part of Moldovan parliament website infrastructure. ASMX indicates legacy technology stack (.NET Framework Web Services). The 'GetCustomEventsCalendar' naming implies other related methods may exist (e.g., GetEventsCalendar, GetOfficialEventsCalendar). Endpoint accepts future dates (2026) without validation error. Consider testing with current month/year to capture actual event data structure."}
