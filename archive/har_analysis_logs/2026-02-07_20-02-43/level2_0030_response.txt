{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. Language selection likely determined by session state, cookies, or Accept-Language headers from the browser.", "response_structure": "Empty JSON response (200 OK status). This suggests the endpoint performs a server-side action (like setting session language preferences) without returning data to the client.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language loading/switching functionality. Part of the sobranie.mk (Assembly of North Macedonia) website's internationalization system. The endpoint likely: 1) Sets user language preference in server session, 2) May trigger server-side language resource loading, 3) Returns empty response as confirmation. The actual language selection mechanism is not evident from this request alone - could be determined by prior requests, session cookies, or HTTP headers. This is a stateful operation rather than a data retrieval endpoint.", "other": "Path structure indicates this is an infrastructure/utility endpoint rather than business logic. The empty response with 200 status suggests fire-and-forget pattern where client may refresh or redirect after calling. Consider investigating: session cookies, Referer header, prior requests in the session flow, and whether there's a corresponding GET endpoint to retrieve current language. This may be part of a larger language selection workflow on the parliamentary website."}
