{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters in URL query string or request body. May accept parameters via POST body (JSON or form data) but this capture shows none. Likely uses session/cookie data or browser headers to determine language context.","response_structure":"Empty response body with HTTP 200 status. Content-Type is application/json but no JSON data returned. This suggests either: (1) successful execution with no data to return, (2) language data loaded into session/server-side state, or (3) response stored in cookies/headers rather than body.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language/localization loading. Part of the sobranie.mk (Assembly of North Macedonia) website infrastructure. POST method suggests state-changing operation rather than data retrieval. Empty response indicates side-effect operation (likely setting language preference in session). May be called during page initialization or language switching. No authentication headers visible but may rely on session cookies. Endpoint path '/Infrastructure/LoadLanguage' suggests this is part of a common infrastructure module handling cross-cutting concerns like internationalization.","other":"Located under /Infrastructure/ path prefix indicating architectural separation of infrastructure concerns. The empty response with 200 OK is unusual - typically would expect confirmation message or language code acknowledgment. May be fire-and-forget operation. Could be called via AJAX during page load. No error handling visible from this single capture. Would need to test with various language parameters to understand full behavior. Related endpoints might exist like SaveLanguage, GetLanguage, or similar variants."}
