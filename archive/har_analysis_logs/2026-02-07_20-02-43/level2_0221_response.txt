{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier (1 observed, likely Macedonian). Month (integer, required): Calendar month number (1-12, value 1 observed for January). Year (integer, required): Calendar year (2026 observed). All parameters submitted via POST body JSON to the generic /Routing/MakePostRequest endpoint.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (likely indicates no agenda items exist for January 2026, or the date is too far in the future). Expected structure when data exists: likely JSON array or object containing parliamentary agenda/session information including dates, titles, descriptions, and event details for the specified month.","documentation_notes":"This is a routing pattern where a generic POST endpoint (/Routing/MakePostRequest) accepts different method names via the 'methodName' field in the request body. The GetMonthlyAgenda method retrieves parliamentary calendar/agenda data for a specific month and year. The empty response for January 2026 suggests either: (1) no scheduled events that far ahead, (2) data not yet populated for future dates, or (3) the method returns empty array/null when no data exists. Language ID 1 likely corresponds to Macedonian language. This pattern suggests other methods may exist using the same routing endpoint with different methodName values.","other":"The sobranie.mk domain is the Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia. This API appears to be part of their parliamentary information system for retrieving legislative calendars and agendas. The routing pattern suggests a single-entry-point architecture where multiple backend methods are invoked through one POST endpoint. Testing with historical dates (past months/years) would likely yield populated responses showing the actual data structure. Other potential methodName values to investigate: GetDailyAgenda, GetWeeklyAgenda, GetSessionDetails, etc."}
