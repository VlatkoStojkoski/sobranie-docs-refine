{"route_type": "GET", "method_name": "sitting.html", "parameters": "None - No query parameters, path parameters, or request body. This is a static HTML file request accessing the sitting (session) interface template or frame.", "response_structure": "HTTP 200 OK with Content-Type: text/html. Response body is empty, suggesting this may be a template file that gets populated dynamically via JavaScript, an iframe placeholder, or the file may have been removed/moved. The empty response could also indicate a redirect scenario not captured in the HAR, or content loaded asynchronously after initial page load.", "documentation_notes": "This endpoint appears to be part of the Moldova parliamentary sitting/session management system within the sobranie.mk (North Macedonia Parliament) website. The path structure '/Scripts/Moldova/sitting/' suggests this is JavaScript-related content or a dynamic HTML component. The empty response is unusual for a direct HTML file request - typical scenarios: (1) File serves as container for AJAX-loaded content, (2) File has been deprecated/moved, (3) Authentication/session required but not provided, (4) HAR capture timing issue where content wasn't fully captured. The 'Moldova' path component is interesting - may indicate historical naming or a specific legislative framework/system name rather than geographic reference.", "other": "Related endpoints to investigate: /Scripts/Moldova/sitting/ directory for other resources, potential API endpoints that populate this HTML template, JavaScript files that interact with this page. The sitting.html filename suggests parliamentary session/meeting functionality - likely displays active sessions, session schedules, voting records, or live session feeds. Check for WebSocket connections, polling endpoints, or REST APIs that provide sitting data. Status 200 with empty body warrants further investigation - may need to examine this with proper session cookies or authentication headers."}
