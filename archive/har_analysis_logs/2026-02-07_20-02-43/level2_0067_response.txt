{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "GetAllStructuresForFilter", "parameters": "methodName (string, required): The backend method to invoke, value 'GetAllStructuresForFilter'. languageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization, observed value 1 (likely Macedonian).", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned with HTTP 200 status. This suggests either: (1) no structures exist matching the filter criteria, (2) the method requires additional parameters not provided in this request, (3) authentication/session required but missing, or (4) the endpoint returns success but data is delivered via alternative mechanism.", "documentation_notes": "This is a generic RPC-style POST endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a router/dispatcher to backend methods. The actual method invoked is specified via the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. GetAllStructuresForFilter appears designed to retrieve organizational or parliamentary structures for filtering purposes (likely used to populate dropdown filters or navigation elements in the UI). The empty response may indicate this is an initialization call that returns no data in certain contexts, or requires additional filter parameters. Pattern suggests other methods can be invoked through this same endpoint by changing methodName value.", "other": "This follows an RPC-over-HTTP pattern rather than RESTful design. The endpoint serves as a single gateway for multiple backend operations. To discover other available methods, enumerate different methodName values. The languageId parameter suggests multi-language support throughout the API. Consider testing with languageId values 2, 3, etc. to discover other supported languages. Empty response warrants further investigation - test with additional parameters or authenticated session to determine if response payload exists under different conditions."}
