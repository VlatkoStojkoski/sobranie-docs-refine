{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value: 1), 'Month' (integer, value: 1 for January), 'Year' (integer, value: 2026). Language appears to be an enum where 1 likely represents a specific language (possibly Macedonian or Albanian). Month is 1-based (1-12). Year is four-digit format.","response_structure":"Empty response received in this capture. Expected structure unknown, but likely returns array of calendar events with date, title, description fields when events exist for the specified month/year. Response format is JSON as indicated by Content-Type header.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services). URL pattern suggests Moldova project/module within sobranie.mk (North Macedonia Parliament website). Service retrieves custom calendar events filtered by language, month, and year. Empty response may indicate no events scheduled for January 2026, or the future date returned no data. The 'Custom' in method name suggests these are manually curated/special events rather than regular parliamentary sessions.","other":"Service path '/Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx' indicates SOAP/ASMX architecture but using JSON over HTTP POST (likely [ScriptMethod] enabled). Domain sobranie.mk is the Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia. The 'Moldova' path segment is interesting - possibly refers to a specific parliamentary hall, building name, or historical reference rather than the country. Consider testing with current/past dates to see populated response structure. Language parameter should be tested with other values (0, 2, etc.) to determine available languages."}
