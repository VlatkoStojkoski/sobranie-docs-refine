{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMaterialDetails","parameters":"MaterialId (string/UUID): Unique identifier for the parliamentary material (e.g., '9cc1c0b1-919e-406f-b654-ea3201a57913'). LanguageId (integer): Language selection for content retrieval (1 appears to be default, likely Macedonian). AmendmentsPage (integer): Pagination parameter for amendments list (starts at 1). AmendmentsRows (integer): Number of amendment rows to return per page (5 in this example).","response_structure":"Empty response returned in this capture. Expected structure likely contains: material details (title, description, type, date), amendment information (paginated list based on AmendmentsPage/AmendmentsRows parameters), metadata (status, voting information), related documents or links. The empty response may indicate: invalid MaterialId, no data available for this material, session timeout, or error condition not properly returned.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint for the Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie) website that dispatches to various backend methods. The actual API method is specified in the 'methodName' field of the request body. GetMaterialDetails retrieves detailed information about parliamentary materials including amendments with pagination support. The MaterialId appears to be a UUID format. The response being empty suggests either: (1) the material doesn't exist, (2) authentication/session issues, (3) the material has no details/amendments to return, or (4) an error occurred but wasn't properly communicated. Standard usage would include authentication cookies/headers not visible in sanitized data.","other":"API Pattern: Generic router pattern where /Routing/MakePostRequest acts as a dispatcher to multiple backend methods based on 'methodName' parameter. This is a common pattern for consolidating multiple API endpoints behind a single HTTP endpoint. Related Methods: Based on this pattern, other methodName values likely exist for different parliamentary data operations (GetMaterials, GetSessions, GetVotes, etc.). UUID Format: MaterialId uses standard UUID v4 format. Pagination: Implements standard page/rows pagination for amendments subsection. Language Support: Multi-language support via LanguageId parameter. Security Note: The empty response and lack of error messaging may indicate poor API error handling or security through obscurity approach. Testing Recommendation: Try different MaterialIds, LanguageId values (2, 3 for other languages), and pagination parameters to map full response structure."}
