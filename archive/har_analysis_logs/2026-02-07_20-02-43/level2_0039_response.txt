{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - Specifies the backend method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier (1 observed, likely represents Macedonian or another default language); Month (integer, required): Month number (1-12), value 2 observed for February; Year (integer, required): Four-digit year, value 2026 observed","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with HTTP 200 status. This could indicate: (1) No agenda items exist for the requested month/year combination (February 2026), (2) The endpoint returns empty array/object for no results, (3) Possible error condition silently returning empty response, or (4) Future date with no scheduled items yet. Expected structure unknown but likely would be array of agenda items with date, title, description, time, and other parliamentary session metadata when data exists","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that acts as a dispatcher for multiple backend methods. The 'methodName' parameter determines which specific operation is executed. The endpoint retrieves monthly parliamentary agenda/calendar data for the North Macedonia Sobranie (Parliament). The request uses a future date (February 2026) which explains the empty response. To discover valid data, try current or recent past months. Language support is present via LanguageId parameter - test with different values (likely 1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian, 3=English based on North Macedonia's language policy). The empty response for a future date suggests no validation errors are thrown for date ranges","other":"Pattern suggests this is part of a larger RPC-style API where /Routing/MakePostRequest serves as a single gateway endpoint for multiple operations. Other potential methodName values to test: GetDailyAgenda, GetWeeklyAgenda, GetAgendaDetails, GetSessionDocuments. The response being completely empty (not even '{}' or '[]') is unusual and may indicate the endpoint behavior differs between 'no results' and actual data scenarios. Consider testing with Month values 1-12 for current year and Year values from 2020-2025 to map available data. The architecture pattern resembles classic ASP.NET MVC routing with a controller dispatcher"}
