{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"Request body (JSON): {\"model\": {\"Language\": integer (1=presumably Macedonian or default language), \"Month\": integer (1-12, calendar month), \"Year\": integer (4-digit year, e.g., 2026)}}. No query parameters. Endpoint: /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx/GetCustomEventsCalendar","response_structure":"Empty response body returned in this capture. Expected structure unknown but likely JSON array or object containing calendar events with dates, titles, descriptions, or event metadata. Content-Type is application/json. Status 200 indicates success despite empty body (possibly no events for Jan 2026).","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services). Service name: CalendarService. Method retrieves custom/special events for parliamentary calendar. Language parameter suggests multi-language support (1 may be Macedonian). Month/Year parameters allow querying specific time periods. Empty response may indicate: (1) no events scheduled for Jan 2026, (2) future date with no data, (3) filter/permission issues. Test with current/past dates to determine typical response schema. Note URL path contains '/Moldova/' which may be routing artifact or namespace identifier for North Macedonia's parliament (Sobranie).","other":"The .asmx extension indicates legacy SOAP/ASMX web service technology being accessed via JSON/REST pattern (WebMethod with ScriptMethod attribute). Server appears to support both SOAP and JSON endpoints. Future API discovery should test both XML/SOAP and JSON request formats. Investigate if similar endpoints exist for regular session calendars vs 'custom events'. Check if Language parameter accepts other values (2, 3, etc.) for Albanian or other official languages. Consider testing with current year/month to obtain sample response structure."}
