{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters in query string or request body. May accept language identifier in headers (Accept-Language) or cookies. Could potentially accept POST body parameters for language selection but none observed in this request.", "response_structure": "Empty JSON response. Status 200 indicates successful execution but no data returned. May return language configuration data in other contexts, or this could be a language initialization/session setup endpoint that sets server-side state without returning data.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language loading/initialization on sobranie.mk (North Macedonian Parliament website). Located under /Infrastructure/ path suggesting system-level functionality. The empty response with 200 status suggests this may be: (1) a language preference setter that stores selection server-side via session/cookie, (2) a preload/cache warming endpoint, (3) an initialization call that returns empty on success, or (4) captured during a state where no language data needed to be returned. Endpoint likely called during page load or language switching. May need to examine headers, cookies, or subsequent requests to understand full behavior.", "other": "Part of Infrastructure module suggesting core system functionality rather than content API. Empty response makes reverse engineering difficult - would need to capture this endpoint with different preconditions, headers, or parameters to understand full capabilities. Consider testing with language codes (mk, en, sq, etc.) as POST parameters or query strings. Check if this endpoint sets cookies or modifies session state. May be paired with GetLanguage or similar retrieval endpoints."}
