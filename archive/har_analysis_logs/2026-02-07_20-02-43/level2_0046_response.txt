{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: Language (integer, value 1 observed), Month (integer, range 1-12, value 11 observed), Year (integer, value 2025 observed). Language appears to be an enum where 1 likely represents a specific language (possibly Macedonian or English). Month and Year specify the calendar period to retrieve events for.","response_structure":"Empty response observed in this capture. Expected structure likely contains calendar events array with event details such as date, title, description, and type. Response format is JSON based on Content-Type header. May return empty when no events exist for the specified month/year combination.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services). Part of the Sobranie (Parliament) of North Macedonia website calendar system. The 'Moldova' path segment in URL likely refers to internal naming or a specific section/module. Service retrieves custom events for a calendar view filtered by language, month, and year. The empty response suggests either no events were scheduled for November 2025, or the query parameters resulted in no matches. This is a stateless query endpoint with no authentication observed.","other":"Service location: /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx suggests this is part of a legacy SOAP/ASMX architecture being accessed via JSON REST-like interface. The .asmx extension indicates ASP.NET Web Services (pre-WCF technology). Base URL pattern indicates this is the official parliament website of North Macedonia. Future testing should include different Language values (0, 2, etc.), current/past months to verify response structure with actual data, and boundary testing for Month (0, 13) and Year values. Consider checking if GET method is also supported or if SOAP envelope format is accepted."}
