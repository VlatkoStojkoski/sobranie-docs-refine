{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"LanguageId (integer): Language identifier (1 observed, likely Macedonian). Month (integer): Calendar month (1-12, value 1 observed for January). Year (integer): Calendar year (2026 observed). All parameters appear required based on request structure.","response_structure":"Empty response received for the analyzed request. This could indicate: (1) No agenda items exist for January 2026, (2) The endpoint returns empty array/object when no data available, (3) Future dates beyond current legislative session return no data. Expected structure likely array of agenda items with date, time, session details, topics when data exists.","documentation_notes":"This endpoint retrieves monthly parliamentary agenda/calendar for the Assembly of North Macedonia (sobranie.mk). Uses generic routing controller '/Routing/MakePostRequest' that accepts 'methodName' parameter to dispatch to specific backend methods. The empty response for January 2026 (future date) suggests the system may only return historical or current session data. Language parameter supports multilingual content. Standard legislative calendar endpoint pattern.","other":"Gateway/routing pattern: All API calls route through single /Routing/MakePostRequest endpoint with methodName discrimination. This is a generic proxy/router pattern rather than RESTful design. Testing recommendation: Try current/recent months (Month: 1-12, Year: 2024-2025) to observe populated responses. Try LanguageId values 1, 2 for different languages (likely Macedonian/Albanian official languages). Related methods may include GetDailyAgenda, GetWeeklyAgenda, GetSessionDetails."}
