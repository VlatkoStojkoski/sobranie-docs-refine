{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. POST request to /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage with no query string parameters and no request body.","response_structure":"Returns HTTP 200 with Content-Type: application/json. Response body is empty in this capture, suggesting either no language data available, an error condition being silently handled, or initialization that doesn't return data.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for loading language resources or localization data. The endpoint name suggests it handles language/locale configuration for the application. Empty response may indicate: (1) language data is cached client-side after first load, (2) default language requires no additional data, (3) actual language selection happens via other means (cookies, headers), or (4) this is a state-setting operation rather than data retrieval. May be called during application initialization or language switching operations.","other":"Part of Infrastructure namespace suggesting core application functionality. POST method for what appears to be a read operation is unusual - may indicate state changes on server (session language setting) or framework convention. No authentication tokens visible in this request. Consider testing with language identifiers in headers (Accept-Language) or as POST body parameters to understand full functionality. Related endpoints likely exist for setting/changing language preferences."}
