{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the backend method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): 1 for primary language (likely Macedonian), possibly 2+ for other languages; Month (integer, required): month number 1-12; Year (integer, required): four-digit year (tested with 2026)","response_structure":"Empty array or object returned when no agenda items exist for the specified month/year combination. Expected structure when data exists likely includes parliamentary session dates, agenda items, meeting schedules, or calendar events for the specified month.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as an RPC-style gateway. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. This pattern suggests multiple methods may be accessible through this single endpoint. The empty response for January 2026 indicates either no scheduled parliamentary sessions for that future date, or the agenda has not been published yet. To discover the full response schema, query historical dates with known parliamentary activity. The sobranie.mk domain indicates this is the Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia. Language switching capability exists via LanguageId parameter.","other":"API appears to use RPC-over-HTTP pattern rather than RESTful design. The routing mechanism centralizes all POST requests through a single endpoint. Future testing should include: current/past dates to obtain populated responses, different LanguageId values (2 for Albanian, 3 for English possibly), boundary testing for Month/Year parameters, and discovery of other methodName values by analyzing additional HAR entries or frontend JavaScript. Consider testing GetDailyAgenda, GetWeeklyAgenda, GetYearlyAgenda, or similar method name patterns."}
