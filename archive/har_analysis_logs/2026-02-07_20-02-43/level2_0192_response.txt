{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"/GetQuestionDetails","parameters":"methodName (string, required): Internal routing parameter set to '/GetQuestionDetails'; LanguageId (integer, required): Language selector, value 1 likely represents Macedonian; QuestionId (string/UUID, required): Unique identifier for the parliamentary question in UUID format (e.g., 'e0298221-720b-43c2-b95e-ef38eda3fa2c')","response_structure":"Empty response body received (status 200). This could indicate: (1) No data found for the provided QuestionId, (2) The question exists but has no details available, (3) Potential error condition not properly handled by API, or (4) Data access/permission issue. Expected response would likely be JSON object containing question details such as text, date submitted, author/MP information, session details, status, and any associated answers or documents.","documentation_notes":"This is a proxy/routing endpoint pattern where the actual API method is specified in the request body via 'methodName' parameter. The '/Routing/MakePostRequest' acts as a gateway that routes to internal methods. This architectural pattern suggests a single-entry-point API design. The GetQuestionDetails method retrieves detailed information about parliamentary questions (interpellations, written questions, oral questions) submitted by members of parliament. The empty response may indicate the QuestionId is invalid, expired, or the question data is not yet populated in the system. LanguageId=1 suggests multilingual support, likely with 1=Macedonian and 2=Albanian based on North Macedonia's official languages.","other":"Endpoint URL: https://www.sobranie.mk/Routing/MakePostRequest; Related to parliamentary oversight and question tracking functionality; Part of the Sobranie (Assembly of North Macedonia) public information system; UUID-based identification system for questions suggests modern database architecture; The routing pattern may be consistent across other API methods on this platform; Consider testing with LanguageId=2 for Albanian language responses; May require session/authentication for certain question details or non-public questions; Empty response warrants further investigation with known valid QuestionIds"}
