{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. The language selection likely depends on session state, cookies, or HTTP headers (e.g., Accept-Language) set by the client.", "response_structure": "Empty response body. Status 200 indicates successful execution. This endpoint likely performs a server-side action (setting session language preference) without returning data, or the empty response indicates the current language context is already established.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language management in the Sobranie (Parliament) of North Macedonia website. This appears to be a utility endpoint that loads or initializes language settings server-side. The empty response suggests this is either: (1) A session state setter that doesn't return confirmation data, (2) A language context initializer called during page load, or (3) May return data under different conditions not captured in this request. The endpoint is under the /Infrastructure path, indicating it's part of the core framework utilities rather than business logic. Language switching functionality is critical for parliamentary websites serving multilingual constituencies.", "other": "Path structure suggests ASP.NET MVC architecture (/Area/Controller/Action pattern). The empty response with 200 status is unusual - typically language endpoints return current language code, available languages, or confirmation. This may be called automatically by the front-end framework during initialization. Consider testing with different Accept-Language headers or cookies to determine full behavior. Related endpoints to investigate: /Infrastructure/SetLanguage, /Infrastructure/GetLanguages, or similar language management routes."}
