{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters required in request body or query string. Endpoint accepts POST request with empty body.", "response_structure": "Empty response body with HTTP 200 status. Content-Type is application/json but returns no JSON data.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language loading functionality on sobranie.mk (Assembly of North Macedonia parliament website). The endpoint path suggests it's part of infrastructure/system operations rather than public API. May be used for server-side language preference initialization or cache warming. The empty response indicates this might be a fire-and-forget operation that triggers server-side language data loading without returning data to client. Could be called during application initialization or session setup.", "other": "Endpoint location: /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage. No authentication headers observed in sanitized request. Empty request/response pattern suggests this might be a trigger endpoint that initiates backend processing (language pack loading, cache population) without returning confirmation data. May set cookies or session state server-side. Consider checking if subsequent requests receive localized content or if browser language headers influence behavior. This infrastructure endpoint might not be intended for direct public consumption."}
