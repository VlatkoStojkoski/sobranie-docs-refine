{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters in query string or request body. May accept language identifier in headers, cookies, or session state. Endpoint appears to rely on implicit context (user session, browser language settings, or cookies) rather than explicit parameters.", "response_structure": "Empty response body with 200 OK status. This suggests the endpoint either: (1) sets language preferences server-side (session/cookie) without returning data, (2) returns empty JSON object/array, or (3) performs language initialization as a side-effect operation. Expected content-type is application/json but actual content is empty.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language loading/switching functionality. Part of the Infrastructure namespace/controller. Likely used during application initialization or language switching. The empty response with successful status suggests this is a state-setting operation rather than data retrieval. May be called via AJAX during page load or when user changes language preference in the Sobranie (Macedonian Parliament) website interface. The endpoint might set server-side session variables or cookies to persist language choice across requests.", "other": "Notable observations: (1) POST method used for what appears to be a configuration/preference operation; (2) No CSRF token visible in this capture - may be handled via headers or cookies; (3) Empty response is unusual for API endpoints but common for fire-and-forget operations; (4) Path structure suggests MVC framework pattern (Controller/Action); (5) May need to inspect response headers for Set-Cookie directives or other language preference indicators; (6) Likely paired with other language-related endpoints for retrieving localized content after preference is set"}
