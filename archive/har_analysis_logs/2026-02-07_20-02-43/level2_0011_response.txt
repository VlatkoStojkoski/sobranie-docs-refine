{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters in URL query string or request body. This endpoint accepts POST method but does not require any payload. Likely relies on session cookies, authentication headers, or user context from the server session to determine which language data to load.", "response_structure": "Empty response body with HTTP 200 status. This suggests either: (1) the endpoint may set cookies or session state server-side without returning data, (2) the response failed to load language data but returned success status anyway, (3) this is an initialization endpoint that triggers server-side language loading without client-side response, or (4) the actual language data may be returned via other mechanisms like response headers or stored in session.", "documentation_notes": "This is an infrastructure/utility endpoint under the /Infrastructure namespace for loading language preferences or localization data. The empty response is unusual for a Load operation - typically such endpoints would return language configuration, translation strings, or locale settings. The endpoint might be used during application initialization or language switching. Given the sobranie.mk domain (Macedonian Parliament website), this likely handles Macedonian/Albanian/English language options. The empty response in this capture may indicate: incomplete HAR capture, error condition, or that the endpoint performs server-side operations only.", "other": "Part of the Infrastructure module which suggests this is a system-level utility endpoint rather than business logic. The LoadLanguage naming convention implies this manages i18n/l10n functionality. Consider testing with different Accept-Language headers, language selection cookies, or query parameters (e.g., ?lang=mk, ?culture=en-US) that may not have been captured in this particular request. May require authenticated session to function properly. Should investigate related endpoints like SetLanguage, GetLanguage, or similar Infrastructure methods."}
