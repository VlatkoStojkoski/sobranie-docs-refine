{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the remote method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): language identifier (1 appears to be default, likely Macedonian); Month (integer, required): month number 1-12 for agenda retrieval; Year (integer, required): four-digit year for agenda retrieval","response_structure":"Empty response returned for future date (2026-01). Expected structure unknown but likely returns array or object containing agenda items/events for valid date ranges. Response is JSON format based on content-type header.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that dispatches to different methods via the methodName parameter. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary agenda/schedule for a specific month and year. The empty response for January 2026 suggests the API only returns data for past/current periods or no events are scheduled. Language support is implemented via LanguageId parameter. Testing with current/past dates would reveal actual response structure. This pattern suggests other methods may be available through the same endpoint.","other":"Endpoint follows RPC-style architecture rather than RESTful design. The /Routing/MakePostRequest path acts as a single gateway for multiple operations. Similar requests with different methodName values would likely expose additional API functionality (e.g., GetDailyAgenda, GetWeeklyAgenda, GetSessionDetails). The sobranie.mk domain indicates this is the Assembly of North Macedonia's official website. Consider testing with LanguageId values 2, 3 for other supported languages (likely Albanian, English)."}
