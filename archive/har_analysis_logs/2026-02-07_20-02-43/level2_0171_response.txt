{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllApplicationTypes","parameters":"methodName (string, required): The RPC-style method to invoke, value 'GetAllApplicationTypes'. languageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization, observed value: 1 (likely Macedonian or default language)","response_structure":"Empty response body returned. Expected structure unknown - may return array of application type objects with fields like id, name, description in normal circumstances. Empty response could indicate: no data available, error condition not reflected in HTTP status, or incomplete capture.","documentation_notes":"This is an RPC-style POST endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a gateway/router for multiple backend methods. The actual operation is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. GetAllApplicationTypes appears to retrieve application/submission types available in the parliamentary system. The languageId parameter suggests multi-language support (North Macedonia has Albanian and Macedonian as official languages). The empty response is unusual and may indicate the method requires authentication, the database has no records, or there was a backend issue not reflected in the 200 status code.","other":"Pattern observed: This is part of a generic routing mechanism where a single POST endpoint handles multiple operations based on methodName - common in older AJAX/RPC-style APIs. The sobranie.mk domain is the Parliament of North Macedonia's website. This endpoint likely serves the public-facing portal for viewing parliamentary applications, petitions, or legislative submissions. The empty response warrants further investigation with authenticated requests or different languageId values. Similar MakePostRequest calls likely exist for other parliamentary data retrieval operations."}
