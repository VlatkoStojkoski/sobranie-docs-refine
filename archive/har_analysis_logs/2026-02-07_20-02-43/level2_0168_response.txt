{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"model object containing: Language (integer, value 1 observed), Month (integer, 1-12 range expected, value 1 observed for January), Year (integer, value 2026 observed). All parameters wrapped in a 'model' object in request body as JSON.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (status 200). Expected structure unknown - may return calendar events array when data exists, or empty response indicates no events for the specified period (January 2026).","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services). Retrieves custom calendar events for the Sobranie (Parliament) of North Macedonia. Language parameter likely corresponds to language codes (1 may represent Macedonian or Albanian). The empty response for January 2026 (future date) suggests either no events scheduled or the service only returns data for past/current periods. Endpoint follows ASMX convention with .asmx extension and method name in path.","other":"Service path includes '/Moldova/' which may be a historical naming convention or organizational structure reference. The date queried (January 2026) is in the future relative to typical capture timeframes, which explains the empty response. This appears to be part of a calendar/scheduling system for parliamentary events. Content-Type is application/json despite ASMX typically using SOAP/XML, indicating modern JSON wrapper implementation."}
