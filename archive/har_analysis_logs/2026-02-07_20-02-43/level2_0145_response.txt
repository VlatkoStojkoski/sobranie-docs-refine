{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"LanguageId (integer, required) - Language identifier (1 observed, likely Macedonian). Month (integer, required) - Calendar month number (1-12). Year (integer, required) - Four-digit year. Request body must be JSON object with methodName field plus method-specific parameters.","response_structure":"Empty array or object when no agenda items exist for specified month/year. Expected structure likely returns array of agenda/calendar items with date, time, title, description fields when data exists. Response is JSON format.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic RPC-style endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that routes to different internal methods via the methodName parameter. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar events for a specific month and year. The empty response for January 2026 suggests either no scheduled events exist for future dates or the system doesn't populate data that far in advance. Testing with current/past dates would reveal actual data structure. LanguageId=1 appears to be Macedonian language based on .mk domain. This routing pattern suggests multiple methods may be available through this single endpoint by varying methodName.","other":"Domain sobranie.mk is the Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia. The generic routing endpoint pattern indicates a backend API facade that multiplexes multiple methods through one HTTP endpoint. Future testing should explore other methodName values, different LanguageId values, and historical date ranges to understand full data structure and available methods. The empty response may also indicate authentication requirements or rate limiting for future-dated queries."}
