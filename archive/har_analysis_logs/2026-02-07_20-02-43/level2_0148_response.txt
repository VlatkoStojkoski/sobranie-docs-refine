{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "GetSittingDetails", "parameters": "MethodName (string, required): The API method to invoke, value 'GetSittingDetails'. SittingId (string, required): UUID/GUID identifier for a specific parliamentary sitting session (format: 03141907-bd27-4ef2-a4a3-bbee47835a5d). LanguageId (integer, required): Language selector for response localization, value 1 likely represents Macedonian language.", "response_structure": "Empty response received (200 OK status). Expected structure unknown - may indicate: (1) sitting details not found for provided SittingId, (2) session expired or invalid, (3) data temporarily unavailable, or (4) response structure needs investigation with valid/different parameters. Typical parliamentary sitting details would include: date/time, agenda items, attendees, voting records, session status, transcripts, and related documents.", "documentation_notes": "This endpoint uses a generic routing pattern where /Routing/MakePostRequest acts as a universal POST handler that dispatches to specific methods based on MethodName parameter. This is a common RPC-style API pattern. The endpoint retrieves detailed information about a specific parliamentary sitting/session from the North Macedonia Parliament (Sobranie) system. The SittingId parameter suggests a database-backed system with unique identifiers for each parliamentary session. The LanguageId parameter indicates multilingual support, consistent with North Macedonia's official languages. Empty response may require testing with currently active or recent sitting IDs.", "other": "API Design Pattern: RPC-over-HTTP using a single POST endpoint with method routing via body parameters. The SittingId format (UUID v4) suggests modern database architecture. Related methods likely exist: GetSittings (list), GetSittingAgenda, GetSittingVotes, GetSittingTranscripts. Consider testing with LanguageId values 2+ for Albanian or other supported languages. The empty response warrants investigation - recommend testing with: (1) recent/current sitting IDs, (2) different LanguageId values, (3) checking if authentication/session cookies are required. Potential sister endpoints: GetMeetingDetails, GetSessionDetails, or similar parliamentary session retrieval methods."}
