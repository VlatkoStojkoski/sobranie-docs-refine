{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllSittingStatuses","parameters":"LanguageId (integer, required) - Language identifier for localization, value 1 observed","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (status 200). Expected structure unknown - may return array of sitting status objects with properties like id, name, description in specified language when data exists","documentation_notes":"This endpoint uses a generic routing pattern where the actual method name is passed in the request body rather than the URL path. The MakePostRequest path acts as a dispatcher/router to various backend methods. GetAllSittingStatuses appears to retrieve all possible statuses for parliamentary sittings/sessions with localized content based on LanguageId. Empty response may indicate no data, system error, or this method requires additional parameters not captured","other":"Pattern: Generic POST router at /Routing/MakePostRequest. Real API method specified via 'methodName' body parameter. This architecture suggests a single-endpoint API gateway that routes to multiple backend services. LanguageId=1 likely represents Macedonian language. The sobranie.mk domain is the Assembly of North Macedonia parliament website. Empty response may warrant investigation - could be authentication issue, database empty, or method requires session state"}
