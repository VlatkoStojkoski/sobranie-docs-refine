{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the RPC-style method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): language identifier, value 1 observed (likely Macedonian as primary language); Month (integer, required): month number 1-12, value 1 observed (January); Year (integer, required): four-digit year, value 2026 observed in test request","response_structure":"Empty response body returned for this request. This may indicate: (1) no parliamentary agenda items scheduled for January 2026, (2) future dates beyond available data return empty, (3) the endpoint returns empty array/null for no results rather than structured response. Expected structure when data exists likely includes array of agenda items with dates, session details, topics, and parliamentary business scheduled for the specified month.","documentation_notes":"This is an RPC-style routing endpoint used by sobranie.mk (North Macedonia Parliament website). The /Routing/MakePostRequest path acts as a generic gateway that dispatches to various backend methods based on the 'methodName' parameter. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary calendar/agenda for a specific month and year. The empty response for January 2026 suggests the system either has no future agenda data or the test used an intentionally out-of-range date. LanguageId=1 likely corresponds to Macedonian language. This endpoint pattern suggests multiple other methods may be available through the same routing mechanism with different methodName values.","other":"API Pattern: RPC-style POST routing gateway (anti-RESTful pattern). The same endpoint URL is reused for multiple operations distinguished only by request body content. Testing notes: Future date (2026) returned empty - try current/recent months for populated responses. Related methods to discover: GetWeeklyAgenda, GetDailyAgenda, GetSessionAgenda, GetCommitteeSchedule (speculative). The routing pattern suggests exploring other methodName values for full API surface discovery. Consider testing LanguageId values 2, 3 for Albanian, English or other supported languages."}
