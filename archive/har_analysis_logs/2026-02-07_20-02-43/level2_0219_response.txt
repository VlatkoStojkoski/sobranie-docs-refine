{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters in URL query string or request body. Likely accepts language preference via HTTP headers (Accept-Language) or session/cookie data, or returns default language if no preference specified.", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned (status 200). This suggests either: (1) language data is set server-side in session/cookie without returning data, (2) this is a no-op endpoint, (3) the endpoint failed silently, or (4) language data is cached and not re-transmitted if already loaded.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language management. Part of the localization/internationalization system for the Parliamentary Assembly of North Macedonia website. The POST method suggests this sets or loads a language preference rather than retrieving language data. The empty response indicates this is likely a state-changing operation (setting user language preference) rather than a data retrieval endpoint. May be called during session initialization or language switching. The lack of response body suggests client already has language resources or they are delivered through other mechanisms.", "other": "Endpoint categorized under 'Infrastructure' namespace, indicating it's a utility/system function rather than content delivery. The empty response with 200 OK status is unusual - typically would expect acknowledgment JSON like {\"success\":true} or redirect information. May warrant further investigation with different Accept-Language headers or authentication states to determine full behavior. Could be part of a multi-step language loading process where actual language resources are fetched via subsequent requests."}
