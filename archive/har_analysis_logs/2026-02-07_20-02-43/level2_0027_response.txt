Expected structure unknown - may return calendar events array when data exists, or null/empty for future dates without scheduled events. Response Content-Type is application/json.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint for retrieving custom calendar events from North Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie). Service located at /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx. Language parameter likely corresponds to locale (1 may indicate Macedonian or English). Request was for January 2026 which returned empty - possibly no events scheduled that far in future, or service returns empty for dates beyond current legislative period. Month uses 1-based indexing (1=January). Service follows ASP.NET Web Services pattern with method name in URL path.","other":"Domain: sobranie.mk (North Macedonian Parliament official website). Path includes '/Moldova/' segment which may be legacy naming or routing convention. ASMX indicates legacy .NET Web Services technology (pre-WCF). Service naming suggests there may be other calendar-related endpoints. Testing with current/past dates may yield populated results. Potential related endpoints to explore: GetEventsCalendar, GetCalendar, or other CalendarService methods. Consider testing Language values 0, 1, 2 for different locales (Macedonian/Albanian/English)."}
