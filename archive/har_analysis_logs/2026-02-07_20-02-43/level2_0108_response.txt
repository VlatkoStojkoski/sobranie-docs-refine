{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value: 1), 'Month' (integer, value: 1 for January), 'Year' (integer, value: 2026). The endpoint accepts a structured model parameter for calendar event filtering by language, month, and year.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (status 200). Expected structure unknown - may return calendar events array when data exists, or empty when no events match the criteria. Likely returns JSON array or object with event details when populated.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET) for retrieving custom calendar events from North Macedonian Parliament (sobranie.mk). The 'Moldova' path segment suggests regional or organizational subdivision. Language parameter likely corresponds to language ID (1 may be Macedonian, 2 Albanian, etc.). Empty response suggests no custom events exist for January 2026, or the future date returned no results. Service follows ASMX/JSON hybrid pattern with JSON request body despite .asmx extension.","other":"Base URL: https://www.sobranie.mk/Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx - Service path suggests multiple calendar-related methods may exist. The empty response for a future date (2026) indicates the service may only return historical or near-term scheduled events. Consider testing with current/past dates for populated responses. Language parameter suggests multilingual support. Standard ASMX service may have WSDL available at base service URL."}
