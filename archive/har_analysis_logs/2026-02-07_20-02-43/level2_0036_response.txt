{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "GetMonthlyAgenda", "parameters": "methodName (string, required): RPC-style method identifier, set to 'GetMonthlyAgenda'. LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization (1 appears to be Macedonian or default language). Month (integer, required): Numeric month value (1-12), in this example 1 for January. Year (integer, required): Four-digit year value, in this example 2026.", "response_structure": "Empty response returned for this request. This could indicate: (1) No agenda items exist for January 2026, (2) Future dates beyond current parliamentary session return empty, (3) The endpoint expects different parameter format, or (4) Data not yet available for requested period. Expected structure when data exists would likely be JSON array of agenda items with date, time, session info, and agenda topics.", "documentation_notes": "This is an RPC-style endpoint using a generic /Routing/MakePostRequest gateway where the actual method is specified in the POST body via 'methodName' parameter. The sobranie.mk (Assembly of North Macedonia) API uses this pattern for multiple different methods rather than REST-style resource paths. The GetMonthlyAgenda method appears designed to retrieve parliamentary session agenda items for a specific month and year. The empty response for January 2026 (a future date at time of likely capture) suggests the API may only return data for current or past sessions. To discover available agenda data, testing should focus on recent past months. The LanguageId parameter enables multilingual support, important for North Macedonia's bilingual parliament.", "other": "Pattern indicates a centralized routing controller common in legacy or ASP.NET MVC architectures. Other potential method names to test at this endpoint might include variations like GetDailyAgenda, GetWeeklyAgenda, GetSessionAgenda, GetAgendaDetails, etc. The numeric LanguageId suggests testing values 1, 2 (possibly Albanian as second official language), and potentially 3 for English. This endpoint structure makes API discovery challenging as available methods are not self-documenting through URL patterns. Consider testing edge cases: Month=0, Month=13, Year with 2-digit format, negative values, and null values to understand validation. The consistent empty response for future dates is notable - suggests data is only populated for scheduled/past sessions."}
