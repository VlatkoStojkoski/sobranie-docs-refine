{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCouncilDetails","parameters":"committeeId (string/UUID format, e.g. 'd596538c-f3d4-4440-8ae7-6e25ea094c6a'), languageId (integer, e.g. 1 for primary language, likely corresponds to Macedonian/Albanian/English language variants)","response_structure":"Empty response in this capture - likely returns council/committee details object when valid data exists. Expected structure unknown but probably includes: committee name, members, description, meeting schedule, status. Response format: JSON","documentation_notes":"Generic POST endpoint that routes to different methods based on 'methodName' parameter. This is a proxy/router pattern where the actual method is specified in the request body rather than the URL path. GetCouncilDetails retrieves information about a specific council/committee by UUID. The empty response suggests either: (1) invalid/non-existent committeeId, (2) no data available for this committee, or (3) access restrictions. The languageId parameter indicates multi-language support on the sobranie.mk (Macedonian Parliament) website.","other":"URL pattern '/Routing/MakePostRequest' indicates a centralized routing mechanism rather than RESTful endpoints. All POST requests appear to go through this single endpoint with methodName discrimination. This architecture suggests exploring other methodName values like: GetCommitteeList, GetMemberDetails, GetSessionDetails, etc. The UUID format for committeeId suggests a modern database backend. Testing with languageId values 1, 2, 3 may reveal Macedonian, Albanian, and English content respectively, reflecting North Macedonia's official languages."}
