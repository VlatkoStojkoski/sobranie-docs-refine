{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllMPsClubsByStructure","parameters":"MethodName (string, required): The API method to invoke, value 'GetAllMPsClubsByStructure'. LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization, value 1 observed (likely Macedonian). StructureId (string, required): UUID identifier for parliamentary structure/organization, format GUID, example '5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473'.","response_structure":"Empty response returned in this capture. Expected structure unknown but method name suggests should return collection of MPs (Members of Parliament) organized by clubs/parliamentary groups within a specific structure. Likely returns array of objects with MP details and club/group associations.","documentation_notes":"Generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest acts as dispatcher for multiple API methods. Actual method determined by MethodName parameter in POST body. This is a facade/proxy pattern. GetAllMPsClubsByStructure retrieves MPs grouped by parliamentary clubs for a given structure ID. Empty response may indicate: no data for provided StructureId, invalid StructureId, or server-side error without error response. LanguageId 1 likely represents Macedonian language based on .mk domain. Structure appears to be organizational unit within parliament (possibly convocation/term/session).","other":"Endpoint uses generic routing mechanism instead of RESTful paths. All POST requests go through same URL with method specified in body. StructureId uses GUID format suggesting database-driven architecture. This pattern common in legacy or .NET applications. To discover other methods, would need to enumerate MethodName values. Response was empty which is unusual - may need authentication, different parameters, or StructureId may be invalid/expired. Consider testing with different StructureIds or checking if session/authentication required."}
