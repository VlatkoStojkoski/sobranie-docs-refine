{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"/GetAmendmentDetails","parameters":"languageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization (e.g., 1 for default language). amendmentId (string/UUID, required): Unique identifier for the amendment in UUID format (e.g., '9a130205-3d0a-4394-a0b1-a0ac4b15a047'). methodName (string, required): Internal routing parameter specifying the target endpoint ('/GetAmendmentDetails').","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (status 200). This could indicate: (1) No amendment details found for the provided amendmentId, (2) Authentication/authorization failure silently handled, (3) Endpoint implementation issue, or (4) Data not yet available for this amendment.","documentation_notes":"This is a meta-routing endpoint where the actual API method is specified via the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. The base path '/Routing/MakePostRequest' acts as a dispatcher/proxy that routes to the real endpoint '/GetAmendmentDetails'. This pattern suggests a single-entry-point architecture for POST requests. The amendment system likely relates to parliamentary legislative amendments given the sobranie.mk (Macedonian Parliament) domain. The empty response may warrant investigation - either the amendmentId is invalid, or there's an error condition not properly communicated in the response. Typical amendment details would include text, proposer information, status, voting records, and related legislation references.","other":"The routing pattern suggests other endpoints may follow the same structure: POST to /Routing/MakePostRequest with methodName parameter specifying the actual operation. This is an unconventional API design that obscures the true endpoint structure. The UUID format for amendmentId indicates a modern database schema. Consider testing with different languageId values (likely 1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian, 3=English based on North Macedonia's official languages). The empty response without error status suggests poor API design or incomplete implementation. Recommended to capture successful responses to understand the actual data structure."}
