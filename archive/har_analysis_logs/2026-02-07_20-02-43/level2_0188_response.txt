{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - Specifies the backend method to invoke. LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier (1 observed, likely Macedonian). Month (integer, required): Month number (1-12), value 1 observed for January. Year (integer, required): Four-digit year, value 2026 observed in request.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with HTTP 200 status. This could indicate: (1) No agenda items exist for January 2026, (2) Future date beyond available data range, (3) Endpoint returns empty array/object when no results found, or (4) Potential API error with silent failure. Expected structure likely JSON array of agenda items when data exists, possibly containing fields like date, time, title, description, session type, etc.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that dispatches to backend methods via 'methodName' parameter. The /Routing/MakePostRequest pattern suggests a centralized RPC-style gateway rather than RESTful design. Request for January 2026 (future date at time of likely capture) returned empty, which may indicate the API only serves historical/current data or the parliament had no scheduled sessions that far in advance. Language support indicated by LanguageId parameter. Similar methods likely exist for daily/weekly agendas, session details, and other parliamentary scheduling data. Test with current/past dates for populated responses.","other":"The empty response for a future date (2026) suggests temporal boundaries on available data. The routing pattern indicates other methodName values can be discovered by testing variations like 'GetDailyAgenda', 'GetWeeklyAgenda', 'GetAgendaDetails', etc. The LanguageId parameter implies multi-language support (likely Macedonian, Albanian, English based on North Macedonia's official languages). This endpoint appears to be part of the North Macedonian Parliament's public information system. Response may include pagination parameters when data exists. Consider testing with Month values 1-12 and recent Year values to map data availability."}
