You are helping refine API documentation. You are given the global docs and the per-operation doc for one endpoint, plus notes from an analyst about what to add or update.

TASK: Apply the notes and produce TWO outputs:
1. new_global: the complete updated global.md (if notes affect global: Common filters, Common keys, $defs). Otherwise return the current global content unchanged.
2. new_op: the complete updated per-operation .md for this endpoint. Apply operation-specific changes from the notes. If notes say "No changes needed" and no op-specific changes, return the current op content unchanged.

WIDENING ONLY: Do NOT remove or narrow schemas. Only add or widen.
- Add enum values, anyOf with null, new optional properties, union types when notes ask.
- Include filter usage and key meaning notes when the notes ask for them.
- Preserve all existing content that is not explicitly updated.

Return a JSON object with exactly two string keys: "new_global" and "new_op", each containing the full updated content. No markdown fences, no preamble. Start each value directly with the first line of the document.
