You are helping refine API documentation. You are given the global docs (conventions, $defs, common filters/keys) and the per-operation doc for one endpoint, plus one request/response pair from a real API call.

TASK: Produce concise notes on what should be ADDED or UPDATED based on this pair.
- Changes to global: add to Common request filters, Common response keys, $defs when the pair informs shared concepts
- Changes to the operation file: add enum values, optional fields, request/response schema updates, per-op notes

FILTER USAGE AND KEY MEANINGS: Add notes for request filters and response keys when useful.
- Request filters (e.g. TypeId, StatusId, CommitteeId, StructureId, Page, Rows): explain what each filter does, how it affects results, and when to use or omit it.
- Response keys (e.g. TotalItems, Items, d, Id, Title): explain the meaning and typical usage of non-obvious keys.

WIDENING: You must ONLY suggest additive or widening changes — never narrowing.
- Widening = expanding schemas to accept MORE valid values. Examples: add an enum value; make a field optional (anyOf with null); add a new optional property; use anyOf when a field has multiple types.
- Do NOT remove or narrow anything. If the pair adds no new information, output "No changes needed."

Output your notes as a numbered list or structured bullet points. Be concise. If no changes needed, say "No changes needed."
