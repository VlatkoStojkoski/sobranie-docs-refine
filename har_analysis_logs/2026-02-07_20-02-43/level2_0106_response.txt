{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "None visible in this request. The endpoint accepts POST requests without query parameters or request body. May accept parameters in headers (e.g., Accept-Language) or cookies to determine language preference, or may rely on session state.", "response_structure": "Empty response body with 200 OK status. This suggests the endpoint may: (1) set language preference in session/cookies without returning data, (2) return empty on error/invalid state, or (3) be designed for side-effects only (setting server-side language state).", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language management. Located under /Infrastructure namespace suggesting it's a utility/system endpoint rather than business logic. The 'Load' prefix implies it retrieves or initializes language settings. Despite POST method, no payload is sent, which is unusual - typically POST endpoints accept data. The empty response indicates this is likely a state-changing operation (setting user language preference) rather than data retrieval. May require authentication/session cookies to function properly. The endpoint might populate language-specific content in subsequent requests or update session state for localization purposes.", "other": "Anomalies: (1) POST method with no request body is unconventional - GET would be more semantic for loading/retrieving, (2) Empty response provides no feedback on success/failure or language loaded, (3) No error details visible. Testing recommendations: Check response headers for Set-Cookie or session tokens; verify if subsequent requests return localized content; test with different Accept-Language headers; check if authentication is required; examine if this is called as part of an initialization sequence. Related endpoints likely exist: GetLanguage, SetLanguage, or language-specific content endpoints."}
