{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "GetAllStructuresForFilter", "parameters": "methodName: string (value: 'GetAllStructuresForFilter'), languageId: integer (value: 1, likely language selection where 1 may represent Macedonian or another primary language)", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned. This could indicate: (1) no data available, (2) authentication/session requirement not met, (3) endpoint returns empty array/object when no structures exist, or (4) potential error condition returning 200 with empty body", "documentation_notes": "This is a generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a dispatcher/proxy for multiple backend methods. The actual operation is determined by the 'methodName' parameter. This pattern suggests a single HTTP endpoint that routes to different backend services. The method 'GetAllStructuresForFilter' implies retrieval of organizational structures or data hierarchies for filtering purposes (possibly parliamentary committees, working groups, or organizational units). The languageId parameter indicates multi-language support on the sobranie.mk (Macedonian Parliament) website. Empty response may require authenticated session or specific request headers from browser context.", "other": "Pattern observed: generic POST router endpoint rather than RESTful design. To discover other available methods, look for other 'methodName' values in HAR captures. The empty response with 200 status is unusual and warrants investigation - may need cookies, CSRF tokens, or referer headers. Consider testing with languageId values 2, 3, etc. to discover other supported languages. This endpoint likely part of internal API not intended for public consumption."}
