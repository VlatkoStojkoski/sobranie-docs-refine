{"route_type": "GET", "method_name": "getQuestionsTemplate", "parameters": "None - no query parameters or request body. Static file path: /Scripts/Moldova/questions/questions.html", "response_structure": "Empty HTML response (0 bytes). Expected to be an HTML template or partial view for parliamentary questions interface, but returned empty content.", "documentation_notes": "This appears to be a static HTML template file located in the Scripts/Moldova/questions directory, likely used as a client-side template for rendering parliamentary questions in the Moldova module. The empty response suggests either: (1) the file doesn't exist at this path, (2) it's been removed/deprecated, (3) it's a placeholder that gets populated dynamically, or (4) there's an access/permission issue. The path structure indicates this is part of a modular frontend architecture where 'Moldova' may refer to a specific parliamentary module or theme. The .html extension in the Scripts directory (typically used for JavaScript) is unusual and suggests this might be an Angular/other framework template file.", "other": "URL pattern suggests a modular architecture with country/region-specific components (Moldova). The 'questions' subdirectory implies functionality for parliamentary questions/inquiries. Status 200 with empty body is unusual - typically would return 404 if file missing, suggesting intentional empty response or misconfiguration. No authentication headers observed. This endpoint does not appear to be a true API endpoint but rather a static resource request that would typically be cached by browsers. May be deprecated legacy code from when the system supported multiple parliamentary instances (Moldova reference)."}
