{"route_type":"POST /Routing/MakePostRequest","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - Specifies the backend method to invoke. LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier (1 observed, likely 1=Macedonian). Month (integer, required): Month number 1-12 (value 1 observed for January). Year (integer, required): Four-digit year (2026 observed in test request).","response_structure":"Empty response received in this capture. Expected structure unknown - may return array of agenda items/events for the specified month and year, or may return empty when no data exists for future dates. Typical parliamentary agenda APIs return objects with date, event_type, title, description, participants fields.","documentation_notes":"This is a routing proxy endpoint that dispatches to internal methods via the 'methodName' parameter. The GetMonthlyAgenda method retrieves parliamentary calendar/agenda data for a specific month and year. The empty response suggests either: (1) no agenda scheduled for January 2026, (2) future dates return empty, or (3) the request was malformed. This pattern indicates a generic RPC-style API where multiple methods are accessed through a single POST endpoint. Testing with current/past dates recommended to observe actual response structure.","other":"API Pattern: RPC-style routing proxy. The /Routing/MakePostRequest endpoint acts as a universal gateway accepting methodName to dispatch different backend operations. This is common in older .NET applications. Security consideration: LanguageId suggests multi-language support. The sobranie.mk domain is the Assembly of North Macedonia parliament website. Similar methodName values likely exist for other parliamentary data (sessions, MPs, legislation, voting records). Consider testing with Month/Year combinations in the past or present to get non-empty responses."}
