{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the remote method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): 1 for primary language (likely Macedonian), presumably supports multiple language codes; Month (integer, required): month number 1-12, value 11 in example; Year (integer, required): four-digit year, value 2025 in example","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with 200 status. This may indicate: (1) no agenda items exist for November 2025, (2) future date returns empty, (3) error condition with successful HTTP status, or (4) the endpoint requires authentication/session state not present in request. Expected structure likely JSON array of agenda items with date, title, description, session type when data exists.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that dispatches to different backend methods based on methodName parameter. The /Routing/MakePostRequest path acts as a single entry point for multiple API operations. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary agenda/schedule for specified month and year. Empty response for future date (November 2025) suggests endpoint may only return historical or current month data, or the legislative calendar hasn't been published that far ahead. Language support indicates multilingual content availability. Similar pattern likely used for other sobranie.mk API methods.","other":"Domain sobranie.mk is the Assembly of North Macedonia (parliament website). This RPC-style endpoint pattern differs from RESTful conventions. No authentication headers observed. Response being empty for future month is significant - test with current/past months to understand data availability window. Other methodName values to explore: GetDailyAgenda, GetSessionDetails, GetLegislationList, etc. The LanguageId parameter suggests testing values 1, 2 for Macedonian/Albanian or Macedonian/English language pairs."}
