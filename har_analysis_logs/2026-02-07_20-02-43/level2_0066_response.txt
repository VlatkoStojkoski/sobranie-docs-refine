{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllSittingStatuses","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetAllSittingStatuses' - specifies the backend method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): 1 - language identifier for localization, likely 1=Macedonian, potentially supports other language codes for multilingual content","response_structure":"Empty response returned in this capture. Expected structure unknown but likely returns array of sitting status objects containing status identifiers, names, and possibly descriptions in the specified language. Common sitting statuses might include scheduled, in-progress, completed, cancelled, postponed, etc.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint that acts as an RPC-style dispatcher. The '/Routing/MakePostRequest' path accepts a JSON body with 'methodName' to determine which backend method to execute. This pattern suggests the API uses a single entry point for multiple operations rather than RESTful resource-based routing. GetAllSittingStatuses appears to retrieve a reference list of all possible statuses for parliamentary sitting sessions. The empty response may indicate: no data exists, session/authentication issue, or this was a preflight/OPTIONS equivalent check.","other":"The sobranie.mk domain is the official website of the Assembly of North Macedonia (parliament). This endpoint is part of their parliamentary information system. The RPC-style routing pattern (single endpoint + methodName parameter) is uncommon in modern REST APIs but allows for easy method discovery through the methodName field. Other likely methods following this pattern might include GetSittings, GetMPs, GetCommittees, etc. The LanguageId parameter suggests bilingual support (Macedonian/Albanian or Macedonian/English). Authentication mechanism unknown - may be session-based or public. Empty response warrants investigation with valid session/authentication."}
