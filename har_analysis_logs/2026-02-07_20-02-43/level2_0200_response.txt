{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. This is a POST request to /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage with no query string parameters and no request body. The endpoint appears to be callable without any input data.","response_structure":"Empty response body. Status 200 OK with Content-Type: application/json, but the actual response payload is empty. This suggests either: (1) the endpoint performs a server-side action without returning data, (2) the language data is cached/stored server-side for the session, or (3) the response may vary based on cookies/session state not visible in this capture.","documentation_notes":"This endpoint appears to be part of the Infrastructure namespace/module for the sobranie.mk (North Macedonia Parliament) website. The method name 'LoadLanguage' suggests it initializes or sets language preferences for the user session. The empty response with successful status indicates this is likely a configuration/initialization endpoint rather than a data retrieval endpoint. It may set server-side session variables or cookies to determine the language context for subsequent requests. The endpoint might rely on Accept-Language headers, existing session cookies, or default to a specific language when called without parameters.","other":"Pattern observed: This follows a namespace/action routing pattern common in ASP.NET MVC/WebAPI applications (/Infrastructure/LoadLanguage). The empty POST body and empty JSON response suggest this might be triggered on page load or language selection events. Worth investigating: (1) Does this endpoint set cookies? (2) Are there related endpoints like /Infrastructure/SetLanguage or /Infrastructure/GetLanguage? (3) Does calling this affect subsequent API responses? (4) What happens with different Accept-Language headers? This endpoint may be part of a larger localization infrastructure."}
