{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters in request body or query string. Likely accepts optional parameters for language selection (e.g., language code, locale identifier) but current request sent none. May use session/cookie data or default to server-side language detection based on headers.", "response_structure": "Empty JSON response (status 200). Expected structure unknown - may return language configuration object, translation keys, locale settings, or confirmation message when parameters provided. Empty response suggests either: 1) default language already loaded, 2) language data cached client-side, 3) session state updated without explicit confirmation, or 4) error condition returning empty instead of error code.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for internationalization/localization functionality. LoadLanguage suggests dynamic language switching capability for the Sobranie (Macedonian Parliament) website. Endpoint appears to handle language preference storage or retrieval. The /Infrastructure path prefix indicates core system functionality rather than content-specific operations. Success response (200) with empty body may indicate fire-and-forget pattern or server-side session update. Client likely follows this call with content requests in selected language.", "other": "Potential use cases: 1) Initialize language on page load, 2) Switch UI language without page reload, 3) Store user language preference, 4) Retrieve available language options. Testing recommendations: Send with language parameters (mk, en, al for Macedonian, English, Albanian), check Accept-Language header influence, verify session/cookie changes, test with invalid language codes. Related endpoints likely exist: GetLanguages, SetLanguage, GetTranslations. Security consideration: validate language codes to prevent injection attacks if file paths constructed from input."}
