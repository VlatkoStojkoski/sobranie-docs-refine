{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value: 1), 'Month' (integer, value: 1 for January), 'Year' (integer, value: 2026). All three fields appear required for the calendar request.","response_structure":"Empty response returned for this request (status 200). Normal response likely returns JSON array or object with calendar events. Empty result may indicate no events exist for January 2026, or the future date (2026) is outside valid data range.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET SOAP/JSON service) for Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie) calendar system. The '/Moldova/' path segment is unusual - may be legacy naming, typo, or modular structure. Language parameter 1 likely represents Macedonian or English (test other values like 0, 2 for alternate languages). Service retrieves custom calendar events for specified month/year. Empty response suggests endpoint works but has no data for requested period. Try current/past dates for populated responses.","other":"Service hosted under /services/ directory with .asmx extension indicating Microsoft ASP.NET Web Services. The 'GetCustomEventsCalendar' naming suggests there may be other related endpoints like 'GetEventsCalendar', 'GetStandardEventsCalendar', etc. in same CalendarService.asmx file. Test various Language values (0-2), valid month ranges (1-12), and historical years (2020-2024) to understand data availability. Check for WSDL at CalendarService.asmx?WSDL for complete service definition."}
