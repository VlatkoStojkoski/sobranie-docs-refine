{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No request body parameters or query parameters. Appears to accept empty POST request. May depend on session/cookie data or Accept-Language headers for determining language context.","response_structure":"Returns empty response body with 200 status code and application/json content-type. The empty response suggests this endpoint may: (1) set session state server-side without returning data, (2) return an empty JSON object/array that was sanitized, or (3) fail silently when no language preference is detected.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language/localization management. The '/Infrastructure/' path prefix suggests internal system functionality rather than public API. Method name 'LoadLanguage' implies it loads or sets language preferences for the session. Empty response with JSON content-type is unusual - typically would expect language data, available languages list, or success confirmation. This may be a state-setting endpoint that configures user language preference server-side (possibly via cookies/session) without returning payload. Could be called during application initialization or language switcher interactions. The sobranie.mk domain (Macedonian Parliament) likely supports multiple languages (Macedonian, Albanian, English).","other":"Endpoint behavior suggests session-based operation. To fully document would need to: (1) examine request headers for Accept-Language or custom language headers, (2) check response cookies for language preference storage, (3) test with different language parameters if supported, (4) verify if subsequent requests reflect language changes. The empty response may indicate this is a legacy endpoint or one that has been deprecated but remains for backwards compatibility. Consider testing with request body containing language codes like {\"language\":\"mk\"} or {\"language\":\"en\"} to see if it accepts parameters."}
