{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the backend method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): 1 for primary language, likely Macedonian, presumably supports other language IDs for translations; Month (integer, required): month number 1-12, in this example 1 for January; Year (integer, required): four-digit year, in this example 2026 for future date","response_structure":"Empty response body returned for this request. This could indicate: (1) no agenda items exist for January 2026, (2) future dates return empty results, (3) error condition with 200 status, or (4) the date is beyond available data range. Expected structure when data exists likely includes array of agenda items with date, time, title, description, session type, and possibly links to documents or video streams","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a dispatcher/proxy to multiple backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. This pattern suggests the API uses a single entry point for multiple operations rather than RESTful resource-based endpoints. The GetMonthlyAgenda method retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar events for a specified month and year. The empty response for January 2026 suggests either no scheduled events exist that far in advance or the system only returns data for past/current periods. Testing with current or past dates would confirm expected response structure. The LanguageId parameter indicates multilingual support, consistent with North Macedonia's official languages (Macedonian and Albanian)","other":"URL base is www.sobranie.mk (Assembly of North Macedonia parliament website). The routing pattern /Routing/MakePostRequest with methodName in body is unconventional but indicates a RPC-style API architecture. To discover other available methods, examine HAR for other methodName values used in requests to this same endpoint. Related methods might include GetDailyAgenda, GetYearlyAgenda, GetSessionDetails, GetMPList, GetLegislation, etc. Testing boundary conditions recommended: past dates, current month, invalid month/year values, different LanguageId values. Consider checking response headers for pagination or metadata hints. The parliament session calendar is public information so authentication may not be required for this endpoint"}
