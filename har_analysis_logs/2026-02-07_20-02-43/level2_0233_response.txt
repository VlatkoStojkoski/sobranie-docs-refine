{"route_type":"GET","method_name":"getSingleNewsInstanceTemplate","parameters":"None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. It returns a static HTML template file.","response_structure":"HTML template file (minified). Response body appears empty in this capture, likely due to HAR sanitization or the file being a minimal/stub template. Expected structure would be an Angular/JavaScript template for rendering individual news items, possibly containing placeholder directives or template syntax.","documentation_notes":"This endpoint serves a minified HTML template component located at /scripts/news/singleNewsInstance.min.html. The '.min.html' extension indicates this is a minified/optimized template file, commonly used in frontend frameworks for client-side rendering. This appears to be part of a news display system on the Macedonian Parliament (sobranie.mk) website. The template is likely loaded dynamically by JavaScript to render individual news article instances. The empty response body in this capture may indicate: 1) The file is genuinely minimal/empty, 2) HAR sanitization removed content, or 3) The template contains only whitespace or comments that were stripped. This is a static asset endpoint rather than a dynamic API endpoint.","other":"File location suggests modular frontend architecture with templates organized under /scripts/news/. The naming convention 'singleNewsInstance' implies there may be related endpoints for news lists or other news-related templates. This is a client-side template resource, not a REST API data endpoint. No authentication headers or cookies appear to be required for access. Status 200 indicates successful retrieval. The .min extension follows common web optimization practices for production deployments."}
