{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters required in request body or query string. This appears to be a session-based or cookie-based language loading endpoint that likely relies on user session data or browser Accept-Language headers to determine which language resources to load.", "response_structure": "Empty response body with HTTP 200 status. The empty response suggests this endpoint may: (1) Set session/cookie values without returning data, (2) Return data through headers rather than body, (3) Be intended for side-effects only (language preference storage), or (4) Return empty when no language change is needed. Expected response format would be JSON based on Content-Type header, but actual response is empty string.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language management in the Sobranie (Parliament of North Macedonia) website. Located under /Infrastructure namespace suggesting it's a utility/support function rather than core business logic. The endpoint likely handles user language preference initialization or updates. Since response is empty, the client may need to make subsequent requests to retrieve localized content, or this may trigger server-side session configuration. The POST method suggests state modification (setting language preference) rather than data retrieval.", "other": "Important observations: (1) Endpoint returns empty body despite application/json Content-Type, which is unusual but may indicate initialization-only purpose. (2) No authentication tokens visible, suggesting this is a public/anonymous endpoint. (3) The Infrastructure namespace may contain other utility endpoints for site functionality. (4) This could be called during page load or language switch actions. (5) May need to examine response headers or cookies to understand full behavior. (6) Related endpoints might include language selection lists or content retrieval with language parameters."}
