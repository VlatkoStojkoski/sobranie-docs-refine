{"route_type": "GET", "method_name": "getSittingPage", "parameters": "None - this is a static HTML page request with no query parameters or request body", "response_structure": "text/html - Returns an empty HTML document (0 bytes). This appears to be either a placeholder page, a page that loads content dynamically via JavaScript, or possibly an error/deleted resource", "documentation_notes": "This endpoint serves a static HTML page related to parliamentary sittings from the Moldova section. The URL path structure suggests this is part of a templated system (/Scripts/Moldova/sitting/sitting.html) that may have similar patterns for other parliamentary sections. The empty response indicates either: 1) The page loads content asynchronously via JavaScript/AJAX after initial page load, 2) The resource no longer exists but returns 200 instead of 404, or 3) This is a template/placeholder. The 'Scripts' directory in the path is unusual for modern web applications and suggests this may be legacy infrastructure. To discover the actual API endpoints, inspection of the page's JavaScript assets would be necessary, or monitoring subsequent XHR/fetch requests made after this page loads.", "other": "Path components analysis: 'Scripts' (likely legacy directory structure), 'Moldova' (country/region identifier - interesting since this is North Macedonia's parliament website sobranie.mk, suggesting possible multilingual or historical content), 'sitting' (parliamentary session context). The empty response with 200 status is notable - modern APIs typically return 404 for missing resources. This may indicate a client-side rendered application where the initial HTML shell is minimal and content is populated via JavaScript API calls."}
