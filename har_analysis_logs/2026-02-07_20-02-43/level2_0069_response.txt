{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body parameters. It appears to be a simple POST request without any payload.","response_structure":"Empty response body with status 200. Returns application/json content-type but contains no actual JSON data. This suggests either an error condition, incomplete implementation, or that the endpoint's primary purpose is side-effect based (such as setting a session variable or cookie) rather than returning data.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language loading functionality. The naming convention '/Infrastructure/LoadLanguage' suggests this is an internal utility endpoint, possibly used to initialize or cache language resources on the server side. The empty response despite successful 200 status indicates this may be a fire-and-forget endpoint that performs background operations. Given the sobranie.mk domain (North Macedonian Parliament), this likely relates to multilingual support for Macedonian, Albanian, and possibly other languages. The endpoint may set server-side session language preferences or trigger language resource loading without returning confirmation data. Unusual pattern of POST without parameters - typically language selection would include a language code parameter.","other":"The empty response body is notable - most APIs return at least a status message or acknowledgment. This could indicate: (1) Session-based language handling where the language preference is determined from cookies/headers rather than parameters, (2) A logging or analytics endpoint, (3) Incomplete API implementation, or (4) The actual language data is returned through a different mechanism (cookies, headers). The POST method suggests state-changing operation despite no visible parameters. Consider checking response headers for Set-Cookie or other state management headers. May be part of a larger language switching workflow where the actual language code is passed via referrer, session, or separate request."}
