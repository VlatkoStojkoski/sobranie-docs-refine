{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: Language (integer, value 1 observed), Month (integer, 1-12 range, value 1 observed for January), Year (integer, value 2026 observed). All three parameters appear required within the model object.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with HTTP 200 status. Expected structure unknown - may return calendar events array when data exists for specified period, or empty response indicates no events for January 2026. Content-Type is application/json suggesting JSON response format when populated.","documentation_notes":"ASP.NET ASMX web service endpoint for retrieving custom calendar events from North Macedonia's Parliament (Sobranie) system. Service located at /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx (note: Moldova path component likely refers to legislative/parliamentary context, not the country). Language parameter of 1 suggests multi-language support (possibly 1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian or other). Query targets future date (January 2026) which returned empty, suggesting either no scheduled events exist that far ahead or calendar data only maintained for current/recent periods. This is a calendar-specific service separate from main legislative data APIs.","other":"Path contains '/Moldova/' which is unusual for sobranie.mk (North Macedonia parliament) - may be legacy naming or internal designation. ASMX extension indicates legacy ASP.NET Web Services (SOAP-based) being called via JSON/HTTP POST rather than traditional SOAP envelope. Future date query (2026) returned empty suggesting endpoint validates requests but has no future event data. Service may be used for displaying parliamentary session calendars, committee meetings, or other legislative events on the public website."}
