{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetOfficialVisitsForUser","parameters":"model (string, required): UUID/GUID identifier, likely representing a user ID or session token. Example: '914bff80-4c19-4675-ace4-cb0c7a08f688'. Sent as JSON in request body.","response_structure":"Returns JSON array or object. Empty response in this capture suggests no official visits exist for the specified user/model ID, or the ID is invalid. Expected structure likely contains visit records when data exists (dates, locations, purposes, officials involved).","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services). Part of Moldova subdirectory structure suggesting country-specific implementation. Service name 'OfficialVisits' indicates functionality for tracking/managing official governmental visits. The GetOfficialVisitsForUser method retrieves visit records filtered by user/model identifier. Empty response may indicate: (1) user has no visits, (2) invalid user ID, (3) authorization issues, or (4) data not yet populated. ASMX services typically support both SOAP and JSON protocols; this implementation uses JSON over HTTP POST.","other":"Base path pattern: /Moldova/services/[ServiceName].asmx/[MethodName]. The UUID format for 'model' parameter suggests modern GUID-based user identification. No authentication headers visible in this capture, but may rely on session cookies or other implicit auth. Service architecture appears to use legacy .NET Framework ASMX rather than modern REST/Web API. Consider testing with valid user IDs to discover full response schema. Related endpoints likely exist for creating, updating, or deleting official visits."}
