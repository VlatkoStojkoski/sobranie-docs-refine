{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value: 1), 'Month' (integer, value: 1 for January), 'Year' (integer, value: 2026). This appears to be a date-range query for retrieving calendar events in a specific language for a given month/year combination.","response_structure":"Empty response body received (likely no events exist for January 2026, or the endpoint returns empty array/null when no data available). Expected structure likely JSON array of event objects when data exists, based on method name suggesting custom events retrieval.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET XML Web Services). The '/Moldova/services/' path suggests this is the Moldovan Parliament (Sobranie) API. Language parameter likely controls localization (1 may represent Macedonian, Albanian, or English - requires testing with other values). Service appears to retrieve custom/special calendar events for parliamentary activities. Empty response suggests either no events scheduled for future date (2026) or service only returns historical data. Standard ASMX pattern with method name in URL path.","other":"Service path indicates legacy .NET Framework ASMX technology. The 'Moldova' path segment is interesting as this is the sobranie.mk (North Macedonia parliament) domain - likely refers to a district or historical naming. Future testing should include: current/past dates to verify data availability, different Language values (0, 2, 3), different months, and check if there's a corresponding GetEventsCalendar method without 'Custom' prefix. ASMX services typically have WSDL available at base .asmx URL."}
