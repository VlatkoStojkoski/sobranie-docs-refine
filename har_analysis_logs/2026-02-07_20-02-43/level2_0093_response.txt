{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No query parameters or request body observed in this capture. This endpoint appears to accept POST requests without explicit parameters, likely relying on session cookies, authentication headers, or server-side context (such as user preferences or browser locale) to determine which language data to load.", "response_structure": "Returns empty response body with HTTP 200 status and application/json content type. This suggests either: (1) the language data was cached/already loaded, (2) the response sets language preferences via cookies or session state rather than returning data, (3) this is an initialization endpoint that triggers server-side language loading without returning content, or (4) the capture occurred when no language change was needed.", "documentation_notes": "This is an infrastructure/utility endpoint under the /Infrastructure namespace for the North Macedonian Parliament (sobranie.mk) website. The LoadLanguage endpoint likely handles language preference management for the multilingual parliamentary website. The POST method suggests this is a state-changing operation (setting language preference) rather than a simple data retrieval. The empty response indicates this may be a fire-and-forget operation where the language selection is persisted server-side (session/cookie) and subsequent page requests will reflect the chosen language. To fully document this endpoint, additional captures would be needed showing: request headers (Accept-Language, cookies), different language selection scenarios, and whether this triggers page reloads or AJAX content updates.", "other": "Infrastructure endpoints like this are typically used for cross-cutting concerns such as localization, theme selection, or user preference management. The sobranie.mk site likely supports Macedonian, Albanian, English, and possibly other languages given North Macedonia's multilingual context. This endpoint may be called during: initial page load, language selector dropdown interactions, or automatic language detection. Security consideration: verify this endpoint has CSRF protection if it modifies user session state. For API integration, developers would need to understand what triggers successful language changes and how to retrieve the currently active language setting (likely through a separate GET endpoint or reflected in subsequent API responses)."}
