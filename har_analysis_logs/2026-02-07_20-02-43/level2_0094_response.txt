{"route_type":"POST /Routing/MakePostRequest","method_name":"GetAllSittings","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetAllSittings' - specifies the remote method to invoke; Page (integer, required): pagination page number, starts at 1; Rows (integer, required): number of results per page, set to 10; LanguageId (integer, required): language identifier, 1 likely represents Macedonian; TypeId (integer, required): sitting type filter, value 1; CommitteeId (string/UUID, optional): filter by committee UUID, null for all; StatusId (integer, optional): filter by sitting status, null for all; DateFrom (string/date, optional): start date filter in ISO format, null for no constraint; DateTo (string/date, optional): end date filter in ISO format, null for no constraint; SessionId (string/UUID, optional): filter by parliamentary session, null for all; Number (integer, optional): filter by sitting number, null for all; StructureId (string/UUID, required): organizational structure identifier '5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473'","response_structure":"Empty response body received (status 200). Expected structure unknown but likely would contain: array of sitting objects with fields like sitting ID, date, time, session info, committee, status, agenda items, and possibly pagination metadata (total records, total pages). The empty response may indicate no sittings matched the filter criteria or a data retrieval issue.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic RPC-style routing endpoint that dispatches to different methods based on the 'methodName' parameter. GetAllSittings retrieves parliamentary sitting sessions with extensive filtering capabilities (type, committee, status, date range, session, number) and pagination support. The StructureId appears to reference the parliamentary structure/body being queried. Empty response suggests either no data available for the given filters or potential API issue. The endpoint pattern '/Routing/MakePostRequest' indicates a centralized dispatch mechanism used throughout the sobranie.mk API rather than RESTful resource-based endpoints.","other":"The UUID StructureId '5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473' may represent the current parliamentary assembly or a specific organizational unit. TypeId=1 may indicate plenary sittings versus committee meetings. The combination of nullable filters suggests flexible querying. This routing pattern is common in legacy or .NET-based architectures. Other methodName values likely exist for different data retrieval operations. Future testing should vary Page/Rows for pagination, change LanguageId for multilingual support (likely 2=Albanian based on North Macedonia's official languages), and test with specific filter values to understand response structure when data is present."}
