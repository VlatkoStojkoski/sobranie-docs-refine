{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No request parameters observed in URL query string or request body. Endpoint accepts POST method but may rely on cookies, session state, or headers (e.g., Accept-Language) to determine language context. Possible implicit parameters: session cookies, authentication tokens, or Accept-Language header that determines which language configuration to load.", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned with 200 OK status. Response is application/json content type but contains no data. This suggests either: (1) language data is cached client-side after first load, (2) response sets cookies or headers with language preferences, (3) endpoint serves as a language selection trigger that updates server-side session state, or (4) endpoint failed gracefully returning empty JSON.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language loading functionality on the Sobranie (Assembly) of North Macedonia website. Located under /Infrastructure namespace suggesting this is a system-level utility endpoint rather than content API. The LoadLanguage method likely handles user language preference initialization or switching. Despite returning empty body, the 200 status indicates successful processing. This endpoint may be called during: page initialization, language switcher interaction, or session establishment. The empty response with JSON content-type suggests the actual language data may be delivered through other mechanisms (cookies, separate endpoints, or embedded in subsequent page loads).", "other": "Path structure indicates modular API design with Infrastructure module prefix. Endpoint naming convention uses PascalCase (LoadLanguage). The POST method for a 'Load' operation is unconventional (GET would be more RESTful) unless this endpoint modifies server state like updating user language preferences in session/database. Consider checking response headers for Set-Cookie or custom headers that may contain language selection data. Potential follow-up investigation: check if other Infrastructure endpoints exist (/Infrastructure/SetLanguage, /Infrastructure/GetLanguage), examine cookies set by this request, and monitor subsequent requests to see if language-specific content is loaded differently."}
