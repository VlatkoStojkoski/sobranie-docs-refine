{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. It appears to be a stateless endpoint that may rely on session cookies or headers (such as Accept-Language) to determine which language data to load.","response_structure":"Empty response body. Status 200 indicates success, but no JSON data is returned. This could mean: (1) The language data is set server-side in session/cookies, (2) The response was actually empty indicating no language data available, or (3) This is an initialization endpoint that sets state without returning data.","documentation_notes":"This is an infrastructure/utility endpoint under the /Infrastructure namespace, specifically for loading language/localization data for the Sobranie (Macedonian Parliament) website. The endpoint name suggests it handles language preference loading or initialization. Given the empty response, this likely sets server-side session state rather than returning language strings. Common use cases: (1) Initialize user language preference on site load, (2) Switch language context during user session, (3) Preload language resources server-side. To fully document this endpoint, would need to capture: request headers (Accept-Language, cookies), response headers (Set-Cookie), and test with different language parameters if they exist.","other":"Namespace: /Infrastructure - suggests this is part of a broader infrastructure API layer for the website. The endpoint returns 200 with empty body which is unusual but valid - indicates side-effect operation (state change) rather than data retrieval. May be called via AJAX during page load or language switching. Related endpoints likely exist: LoadLanguage, SetLanguage, GetLanguage, etc. Without request body or parameters visible, the language selection mechanism is unclear - could be cookie-based, header-based, or use a default fallback."}
