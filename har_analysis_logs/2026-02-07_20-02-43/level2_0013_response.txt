{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. The language context may be determined from session state, cookies, or HTTP headers (e.g., Accept-Language) that are not visible in the sanitized request body.","response_structure":"Empty JSON response - Status 200 with no content in response body. This suggests the endpoint may be performing a server-side operation (like setting session language preferences) without returning data, or the response was truncated/empty in this particular capture.","documentation_notes":"This is an infrastructure endpoint under the /Infrastructure path namespace, specifically for language loading/initialization. The endpoint name 'LoadLanguage' suggests it handles language preference setup or localization data loading for the Sobranie (Macedonian Parliament) website. Despite the POST method, it appears to be idempotent given the lack of parameters. The empty response indicates this may be a fire-and-forget operation or that the actual language data is loaded through other mechanisms (subsequent requests, server-side session setup). This could be called during initial page load or when a user changes language preferences. The endpoint may rely on implicit context like session cookies or referer headers to determine which language to load.","other":"Potential use cases: (1) Session initialization for language preferences, (2) Triggered during language switcher interaction on the website, (3) Part of a multi-step language setup process where this is the initialization call. The empty response is unusual for a LoadLanguage endpoint - typically such endpoints would return language strings, locale codes, or confirmation data. This may indicate the endpoint sets server-side state only, with actual language content delivered via subsequent requests or already embedded in page templates. Worth investigating if there are corresponding GET endpoints or if language data is bundled differently."}
