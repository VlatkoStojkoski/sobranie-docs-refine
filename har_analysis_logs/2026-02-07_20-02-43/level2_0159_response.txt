{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllGenders","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetAllGenders' - Specifies the remote method to invoke; languageId (integer, required): 1 - Language identifier for localization, likely 1=Macedonian or default language","response_structure":"Empty response body returned. This may indicate: (1) No gender records exist in the database, (2) An error occurred but was not properly returned, (3) The endpoint successfully processed the request but returns null/empty for this specific method, or (4) Authentication/authorization may be required but was not provided in the sanitized request","documentation_notes":"This is a generic RPC-style routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a gateway to invoke various backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the POST body. GetAllGenders appears to be a reference data endpoint that should return a list of gender options (likely Male/Female/Other or similar categories) for use in forms or filtering. The languageId parameter suggests multi-language support across the application. The empty response is unusual for a 'GetAll' method and warrants investigation - typical response would be an array of gender objects with id, name, and possibly localized labels.","other":"Pattern identified: This application uses a single POST endpoint as a method router/dispatcher rather than RESTful resource-based routing. All API calls likely go through /Routing/MakePostRequest with different methodName values. This is a common pattern in older .NET applications or those using a service-oriented architecture. To discover other available methods, monitor the methodName values in other requests. The sobranie.mk domain suggests this is the Parliament of North Macedonia website, so gender data might be used for deputy/member profiles or statistical filtering."}
