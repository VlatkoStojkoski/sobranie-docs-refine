{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllSittings","parameters":"Page (integer, pagination): Current page number, default 1. Rows (integer, pagination): Number of rows per page, default 10. LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier, 1 appears to be default. TypeId (integer, filter): Type identifier for sitting classification, value 1 used. CommitteeId (string/null, filter): Optional committee identifier for filtering by committee. StatusId (integer/null, filter): Optional status identifier for filtering sittings by status. DateFrom (string/null, filter): Optional start date for date range filtering (format unknown). DateTo (string/null, filter): Optional end date for date range filtering (format unknown). SessionId (integer/null, filter): Optional session identifier for filtering by parliamentary session. Number (integer/null, filter): Optional sitting number for direct lookup. StructureId (string, required): UUID identifier for organizational structure, value '5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473' used.","response_structure":"Empty response received in this capture. Expected structure unknown but likely returns paginated list of parliamentary sittings with fields such as sitting ID, date, session, committee, type, status, and related metadata. Typical pagination metadata (total records, total pages) likely included in successful responses.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint that accepts a 'methodName' parameter to invoke different backend methods. GetAllSittings retrieves parliamentary sitting sessions with extensive filtering capabilities including date ranges, committees, sessions, status, and type. The endpoint supports pagination through Page and Rows parameters. Empty response suggests either no data matched filters, an error condition not reflected in status code, or potential issue with the specific parameter combination (particularly the StructureId UUID). The routing pattern suggests this is a centralized API gateway where multiple methods share the same endpoint URL with method selection via the methodName field.","other":"The sobranie.mk domain indicates this is the Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie) website API. The generic /Routing/MakePostRequest pattern is unusual - it acts as a single-endpoint RPC-style gateway rather than RESTful design. StructureId UUID suggests hierarchical organizational structure (possibly legislature terms, chambers, or organizational units). Multiple null parameters indicate a flexible query builder pattern. LanguageId=1 likely represents Macedonian language. TypeId=1 may distinguish plenary vs committee sittings. The combination of required StructureId with optional filters suggests structure-scoped queries. Empty response with 200 status is concerning - proper API would return empty array or error status. Worth testing with different StructureId values and simpler parameter sets."}
