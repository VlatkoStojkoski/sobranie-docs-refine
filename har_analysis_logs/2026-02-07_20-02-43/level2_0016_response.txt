{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "No parameters observed in request body or query string. Endpoint appears to accept empty POST request. May rely on session cookies, authentication headers, or browser locale settings to determine language to load.", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned with 200 OK status. This suggests either: (1) the endpoint sets language preference via cookie/session without returning data, (2) it's a client-side state management endpoint, or (3) the language data is loaded through subsequent requests after this initialization call.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language loading functionality. Part of the sobranie.mk (Macedonian Parliament) website's internationalization system. The '/Infrastructure/' path prefix suggests this is a utility/system endpoint rather than content endpoint. Empty response indicates this is likely a state-setting or initialization endpoint rather than a data retrieval endpoint. The endpoint may trigger server-side language preference storage or session configuration without returning confirmation data.", "other": "Endpoint pattern suggests a microservice or modular architecture where infrastructure concerns are separated. The empty POST body and empty response is unusual - typically language selection endpoints accept language code parameters (e.g., 'mk', 'en', 'al') and return confirmation or language resources. This may indicate the language is auto-detected from Accept-Language headers or previously set cookies. Could be worth testing with different Accept-Language headers or examining Set-Cookie response headers. May be part of a multi-step language initialization process."}
