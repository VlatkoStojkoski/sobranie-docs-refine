{"route_type": "GET", "method_name": "getParliamentMPsPage", "parameters": "None - This is a static HTML page request with no query parameters or request body", "response_structure": "HTML document (text/html) - Response body appears empty in the capture, likely due to client-side rendering or delayed content loading. Expected structure would be an HTML page containing information about parliament members (MPs) based on the URL path structure", "documentation_notes": "This endpoint serves an HTML page for displaying parliament members (MPs). The URL path '/Scripts/Moldova/parliamentMPs/parliamentMPs.html' suggests this is part of a Moldova-related section of the sobranie.mk (North Macedonia Parliament) website. The empty response body in the HAR capture likely indicates either: 1) The page loads content dynamically via JavaScript after initial page load, 2) The content requires authentication/session, 3) The page was not fully captured, or 4) There was an error during capture. The naming convention 'parliamentMPs.html' suggests this is a static HTML file rather than a REST API endpoint, though it may contain embedded JavaScript that makes subsequent API calls to fetch actual MP data", "other": "Status 200 indicates successful request. This appears to be a web page endpoint rather than a data API endpoint. The '/Scripts/' directory in the path is unusual for serving HTML pages and typically contains JavaScript files, suggesting this might be a misplaced resource or legacy URL structure. To discover the actual data API, examine network requests made by this page after it loads, as modern web applications typically load HTML shell pages first, then fetch data via AJAX/fetch calls to JSON API endpoints. The 'Moldova' reference is interesting given this is the North Macedonia parliament website - may indicate historical data, comparative legislature information, or a naming artifact"}
