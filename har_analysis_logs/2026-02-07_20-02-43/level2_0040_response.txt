{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value 1 observed), 'Month' (integer, value 2 for February), 'Year' (integer, value 2026). Language appears to be an enum/ID where 1 likely represents a specific language (possibly Macedonian). Month is 1-12 integer. Year is full 4-digit year.","response_structure":"Empty response returned in this capture (status 200). Expected structure unknown but likely returns calendar events array or object for the specified month/year when data exists. Content-Type is application/json suggesting structured JSON response when populated.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET SOAP/XML service exposed as JSON). Path structure '/Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx' indicates this is the Macedonian parliament (sobranie.mk) calendar service. The 'GetCustomEventsCalendar' method retrieves calendar events for a specific month/year in a specified language. Empty response for February 2026 suggests either no events scheduled that far in future or service returns empty for future dates beyond certain threshold. The 'Custom' in method name may indicate user-defined or special event types vs standard parliamentary sessions.","other":"Service appears to be ASP.NET Web Services (ASMX) which is legacy technology but still operational. The '/Moldova/' path segment is interesting as this is the Macedonian parliament site - possibly refers to historical naming or internal structure. Future testing should include: current/past dates to observe populated responses, different Language values (0, 2, etc.), boundary testing for Month (0, 13) and Year values. The empty response makes it difficult to determine exact response schema - recommend capturing requests for current month with known events."}
