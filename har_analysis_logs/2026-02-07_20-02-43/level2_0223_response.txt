{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. This is a POST request to /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage with no query string parameters and no request body. The endpoint appears to accept requests without any input data.","response_structure":"Empty response body. Status 200 OK with Content-Type: application/json. The response is completely empty - no JSON object, array, or any content returned. This suggests either the endpoint is non-functional, the language data is loaded through side effects (like cookies/session), or this particular request failed silently.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for loading language settings. Part of the sobranie.mk (Assembly of North Macedonia) website infrastructure. The endpoint naming suggests it handles language/localization loading functionality. The empty response is unusual for a language loading endpoint - typically such endpoints would return language strings, locale data, or at minimum a success/failure indicator. This could be: (1) A client-side cache priming endpoint that sets cookies/session state, (2) A broken/deprecated endpoint, (3) An endpoint that only works with specific headers or authentication, or (4) An endpoint whose response was stripped during HAR sanitization.","other":"Base path is /Infrastructure/ suggesting this is part of a general infrastructure/utility API grouping. The empty response with 200 status is noteworthy - most functional APIs return some data or at least a status message. Consider testing with language parameter variations or checking if cookies/headers are modified in the response. May need authentication or session context to function properly."}
