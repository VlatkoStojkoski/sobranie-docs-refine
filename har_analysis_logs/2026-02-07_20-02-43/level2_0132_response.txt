{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. This is a POST request to /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage with no query string parameters and no request body. The endpoint appears to accept empty POST requests.","response_structure":"Empty response body. Status 200 with Content-Type: application/json but returns no data. This suggests either: (1) the endpoint performs a side-effect action without returning data, (2) language data is stored in session/cookie, or (3) this may be a deprecated/unused endpoint.","documentation_notes":"This appears to be an infrastructure/utility endpoint for loading language settings in the Sobranie (Assembly) of North Macedonia website. The empty response with 200 status suggests this might trigger server-side language initialization or session setup rather than returning language data directly. The endpoint may rely on cookies, session state, or other request headers (like Accept-Language) to determine which language to load. Given the empty response, this might be setting up language preferences that are retrieved through other endpoints. The /Infrastructure/ path prefix suggests this is a system-level utility endpoint rather than a data retrieval endpoint.","other":"Part of the Infrastructure module of sobranie.mk. The empty response pattern is unusual for a Load operation - typically such endpoints would return the loaded data or at minimum a success confirmation object. This could indicate: the actual language data is cached client-side after first load, the endpoint is used for prefetching/warming caches, or it's a legacy endpoint maintained for backwards compatibility. May need to examine cookies, session headers, or subsequent requests to understand the complete language loading mechanism. Testing with different language preference headers or parameters might reveal additional functionality."}
