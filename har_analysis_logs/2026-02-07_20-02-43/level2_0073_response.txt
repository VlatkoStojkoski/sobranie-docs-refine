{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllSittings","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetAllSittings' - specifies the API method to invoke; Page (integer, required): pagination page number (e.g., 3); Rows (integer, required): number of rows per page (e.g., 10); LanguageId (integer, required): language identifier (1 = likely Macedonian); TypeId (integer, required): type filter for sittings (1 = specific sitting type); CommitteeId (integer/null, optional): filter by committee ID; StatusId (integer/null, optional): filter by status; DateFrom (string/null, optional): start date filter for date range; DateTo (string/null, optional): end date filter for date range; SessionId (integer/null, optional): filter by parliamentary session; Number (integer/null, optional): filter by sitting number; StructureId (string/GUID, required): organizational structure identifier ('5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473')","response_structure":"Empty response body returned despite 200 OK status. Expected structure unknown but likely would contain: array of sitting objects with pagination metadata (total count, pages), each sitting possibly containing: sitting ID, number, date, type, status, committee info, session info, agenda items, and localized text based on LanguageId","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as an RPC-style gateway, dispatching to different methods via the 'methodName' parameter. GetAllSittings retrieves parliamentary sittings with extensive filtering capabilities including pagination, date ranges, committee, status, session, and organizational structure filters. The empty response suggests either: no data matches the criteria (page 3 may be beyond available results), an error occurred but wasn't properly returned, or the endpoint has issues. The StructureId GUID appears to identify a specific parliamentary structure/body. LanguageId=1 likely corresponds to Macedonian language content. This follows a non-RESTful RPC pattern common in legacy .NET applications.","other":"Endpoint pattern suggests a single POST endpoint handles multiple API methods through method dispatch. Other potential methodName values may exist (GetSittingById, GetSittingDetails, etc.). The TypeId=1 parameter suggests multiple sitting types exist. StatusId null suggests various status filters available (active, closed, scheduled, etc.). The combination of null-able filters indicates a flexible query interface. Frontend likely uses this for a filterable, paginated list view of parliamentary sittings. Technology stack appears to be ASP.NET MVC/WebAPI based on routing pattern. Empty response may indicate rate limiting, authentication issues, or legitimate empty result set for page 3."}
