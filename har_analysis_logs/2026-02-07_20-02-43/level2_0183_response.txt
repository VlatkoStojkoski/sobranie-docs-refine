{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the RPC-style method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): 1 for primary language (likely Macedonian), possibly 2+ for other languages; Month (integer, required): month number 1-12; Year (integer, required): four-digit year (tested with 2026)","response_structure":"Empty response body returned for this request. This could indicate: no agenda items exist for January 2026, the endpoint returns empty for future dates, or the month/year combination is invalid. When data exists, likely returns array of agenda items with date, title, description, and event details in JSON format.","documentation_notes":"This is an RPC-style endpoint using POST to /Routing/MakePostRequest as a dispatcher. The actual method is specified via the methodName parameter in the request body. The endpoint retrieves parliamentary monthly agenda/calendar data. Empty response suggests either no scheduled events for the requested period or the system doesn't have future data populated. The LanguageId parameter indicates multi-language support. Standard usage would query current or past months to retrieve actual agenda data.","other":"Pattern indicates a generic routing mechanism where multiple API methods are accessed through a single POST endpoint by varying the methodName parameter. Other potential methods likely exist following similar patterns (e.g., GetWeeklyAgenda, GetDailyAgenda, GetSessionDetails). Future date query (2026) returned empty, suggesting the system may only have historical/current data. Testing with current or recent past dates would likely yield populated responses. The sobranie.mk domain indicates this is the Assembly of North Macedonia parliamentary system."}
