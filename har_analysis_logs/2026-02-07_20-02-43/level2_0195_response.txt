{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the API method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): language identifier (1 observed, likely Macedonian); Month (integer, required): month number 1-12 (value 1 observed for January); Year (integer, required): year as 4-digit integer (2026 observed)","response_structure":"Empty response received for future date (2026-01). Expected structure unknown but likely returns array of agenda items/events with dates, titles, descriptions, and potentially session information when data exists. Response is JSON format as indicated by Content-Type header.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that accepts different method names via POST body rather than traditional REST endpoints. The methodName parameter acts as an internal API selector. The request for January 2026 (future date at time of capture) returned empty, suggesting the API only returns data for dates with scheduled parliamentary sessions/events. To discover actual response structure, query past dates or current month with known parliamentary activity. The LanguageId parameter indicates multi-language support in the API.","other":"API Pattern: RPC-style POST endpoint using methodName routing rather than RESTful URL structure. This suggests multiple methods likely available through this single /Routing/MakePostRequest endpoint. Similar methods may exist for weekly/daily agendas, session details, or other parliamentary data. Consider testing with current/past dates to get populated responses. The sobranie.mk domain indicates this is the Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia's official website API."}
