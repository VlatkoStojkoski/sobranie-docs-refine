{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. POST request with empty body. No query string parameters or request payload needed.","response_structure":"Empty response body. Returns HTTP 200 status with application/json content-type but no actual JSON content. Likely returns empty string or null.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for loading language resources. Part of the /Infrastructure namespace suggesting system-level functionality. May be used for internationalization/localization initialization. Despite POST method, accepts no input parameters. Empty response suggests this might be a trigger endpoint that loads language data server-side without returning it, or could be a client-side cache initialization endpoint. The endpoint likely sets server session state or triggers background language resource loading rather than returning language data directly.","other":"Endpoint path suggests this is part of infrastructure/system configuration rather than business logic. The empty response with successful 200 status is unusual - typically indicates side-effect operation (session initialization, cache warming, state setup). May work in conjunction with cookies or session headers not visible in this capture. Could be called during application bootstrap/initialization phase. Consider checking if subsequent requests receive localized content after calling this endpoint."}
