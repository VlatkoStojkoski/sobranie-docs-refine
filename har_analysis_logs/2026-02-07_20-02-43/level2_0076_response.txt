{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetSittingDetails","parameters":"SittingId (string/UUID format, required) - Unique identifier for a parliamentary sitting session (e.g., '27bf274e-2c3e-45cd-8b53-bd39a7d58bb5'); LanguageId (integer, required) - Language selection identifier (1 appears to be default, likely Macedonian); MethodName (string, required) - Must be 'GetSittingDetails' for this endpoint","response_structure":"Empty response body received (status 200). This may indicate: (1) No sitting details exist for the provided SittingId, (2) The sitting exists but has no associated details yet, (3) An error condition that returns empty instead of error code, or (4) The session/sitting may not be accessible or published. Expected structure unknown - may normally return sitting metadata like date, time, agenda items, participants, voting records, transcripts, or session status when data exists.","documentation_notes":"This endpoint retrieves detailed information about a specific parliamentary sitting session from the Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie) website. Uses a generic routing mechanism via /Routing/MakePostRequest with method dispatch pattern. The SittingId uses UUID format suggesting a database-backed system. LanguageId parameter indicates multilingual support (likely Macedonian, Albanian, English based on North Macedonia's official languages). Empty response suggests this particular sitting may be planned but not yet conducted, or the ID is invalid. This is part of a broader API pattern where multiple methods are routed through a single POST endpoint.","other":"The sobranie.mk domain is the official website of the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia. This generic routing pattern (/Routing/MakePostRequest) is common in .NET applications using a single endpoint for multiple RPC-style operations. The empty response with 200 OK (rather than 404) is noteworthy - production systems should distinguish between successful empty results and missing resources. Related methods likely exist: GetSittings (list), GetAgenda, GetVotingRecords, GetTranscripts. The UUID format for SittingId suggests a modern database schema. Testing with different LanguageId values (1, 2, 3) would reveal supported languages."}
