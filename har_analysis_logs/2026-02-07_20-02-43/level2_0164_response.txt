{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. The language selection appears to be handled through other mechanisms (likely cookies, session state, or HTTP headers such as Accept-Language).","response_structure":"Empty JSON response - Status 200 with application/json content-type but no body content. This suggests the endpoint performs a server-side action (likely setting session language preference) without returning data to the client.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure utility endpoint for language loading/switching on sobranie.mk (Macedonian Parliament website). The endpoint appears to be part of the site's internationalization (i18n) infrastructure. Despite being a POST request, it returns no payload, indicating it likely sets server-side session state or cookies for language preference. The actual language to load may be determined by: (1) HTTP Accept-Language header, (2) existing session/cookie values, (3) browser locale detection, or (4) a previous API call that set the preference. This endpoint may be called during initial page load or when users switch languages via UI controls. The empty response suggests the client should either refresh the page or make subsequent API calls to retrieve content in the newly selected language.","other":"Security note: No authentication tokens observed in this request. The endpoint appears to be publicly accessible. Performance note: Lightweight endpoint with minimal overhead (no response body). Integration note: Likely works in conjunction with other endpoints that serve localized content. The sobranie.mk site likely supports Macedonian, Albanian, and English based on typical parliamentary website patterns. Further investigation needed: Check for Set-Cookie headers in response, examine request headers for language indicators, identify related endpoints that consume the language preference set by this call."}
