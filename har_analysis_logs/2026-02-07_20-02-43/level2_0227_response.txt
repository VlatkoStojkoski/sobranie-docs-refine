Expected structure likely JSON array of calendar events with properties such as event date, title, description, type, etc. Status 200 indicates successful request processing despite empty result.","documentation_notes":"ASMX Web Service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services technology). Service name: CalendarService. Method retrieves custom/special events for parliamentary calendar. Request made for future date (January 2026) which may explain empty response. The '/Moldova/' path segment suggests this is the Moldovan Parliament (Sobranie) website API. Content-Type is application/json despite being ASMX service, indicating JSON serialization is enabled. This appears to be a calendar/scheduling system for parliamentary events, sessions, or activities.","other":"Service path structure: /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx/{MethodName}. The ASMX extension indicates legacy .NET Framework web service. Domain sobranie.mk suggests Macedonian Parliament website. Future-dated request (2026 when current date likely 2024-2025) may be testing or planning functionality. Empty response could indicate: (1) no events scheduled, (2) future dates return empty, (3) data not yet available for that period. Related methods likely exist for getting regular calendar, event details, date ranges, etc. Language parameter suggests multi-language support for the parliament website."}
