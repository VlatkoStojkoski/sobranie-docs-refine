{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body parameters. It appears to be invoked without any input data.", "response_structure": "Empty response body. Returns HTTP 200 status with application/json content-type but no actual JSON content. This may indicate a successful operation that doesn't need to return data, or potentially an error/edge case where language data is unavailable.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for loading language/localization data. Part of the Infrastructure namespace/module. The empty response suggests this might be a client-initiated call that triggers server-side language loading without returning data, possibly setting session state or cookies instead. Could also be used for cache warming or pre-fetching language resources. The endpoint may rely on session cookies or headers to determine which language to load. Given the sobranie.mk domain (Macedonian Parliament), this likely handles Macedonian/Albanian/English language switching.", "other": "Endpoint path structure follows /Infrastructure/[Action] pattern suggesting a modular backend architecture. The empty response with 200 status is unusual for a 'Load' operation - typically would expect language strings, translations, or at minimum a success confirmation. May warrant investigation into response headers for Set-Cookie or other state-setting mechanisms. Could be a fire-and-forget endpoint or one that relies on subsequent requests to retrieve the loaded language data."}
