{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllStructuresForFilter","parameters":"languageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization (1 appears to be default/Macedonian). methodName (string, required): Internal routing parameter specifying the backend method to invoke.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned in this capture. Expected structure unknown - likely returns array of structure objects for filtering purposes based on method name semantics. Possible return: list of organizational structures, parliamentary bodies, or administrative divisions.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that acts as a dispatcher/proxy for multiple backend methods. The actual API method invoked is 'GetAllStructuresForFilter' which suggests retrieving organizational or parliamentary structures used for filtering/categorization purposes. The empty response may indicate: no structures defined, authentication required, session expired, or data unavailable for the specified language. This appears to be part of the Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie) website API for retrieving metadata about parliamentary structures.","other":"Pattern observed: centralized POST routing mechanism where 'methodName' parameter determines backend logic. This design obscures individual endpoints but allows flexible API expansion. The languageId parameter suggests multilingual support (likely Macedonian, Albanian, English based on North Macedonia's official languages). Recommend testing with different languageId values (1, 2, 3) to discover supported languages. Empty response needs further investigation - may require session cookies, authentication headers, or different parameter combinations."}
