{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the remote method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): language identifier (1 observed, likely Macedonian as primary language); Month (integer, required): month number 1-12 for agenda retrieval; Year (integer, required): four-digit year for agenda query (2026 tested)","response_structure":"Empty response observed for future date (January 2026). Expected structure unknown but likely returns array of agenda items/events with dates, titles, descriptions when data exists. Response format is application/json. Empty result may indicate no scheduled items for requested month or future dates not yet populated in system.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint that dispatches to different backend methods based on methodName parameter. The endpoint acts as an RPC-style gateway rather than RESTful resource. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary monthly agenda/calendar. Testing with future dates (2026) returns empty, suggesting either no forward planning data or date validation. Recommend testing with current/past dates to observe actual response structure. The sobranie.mk domain is the Assembly of North Macedonia parliament website. Similar pattern likely exists for other method names discoverable through this routing mechanism.","other":"POST body uses JSON format. No authentication observed in this request. The routing pattern /Routing/MakePostRequest suggests a centralized dispatcher architecture where multiple API methods funnel through single endpoint. Other potential methodName values should be discoverable through frontend JavaScript inspection or HAR analysis of other requests. Empty response could also indicate authorization requirements not met, though no auth headers present. Consider testing Month values 1-12 and recent Year values to map data availability patterns."}
