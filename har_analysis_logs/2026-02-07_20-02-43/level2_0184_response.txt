{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value: 1), 'Month' (integer, value: 1 for January), 'Year' (integer, value: 2026). All three fields appear required for the calendar query.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (status 200). This suggests either no events exist for the requested period (January 2026), the calendar is not populated that far in advance, or this is a legitimate empty result set. Expected structure likely array of calendar events when data exists.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET SOAP/JSON service) for retrieving custom calendar events from the Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie) website. The '/Moldova/' path segment is unusual - may be legacy naming or indicate specific regional content section. Language parameter of 1 likely corresponds to Macedonian language (common pattern: 1=primary language, 2=secondary). Service accepts future date queries (2026). Empty response may indicate forward-looking calendar data is not yet available or no events scheduled.","other":"Service pattern suggests ASP.NET ASMX legacy web services still in use. Potential related endpoints may exist at /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx/ with methods like GetEvents, GetEventDetails, etc. The 'Custom' in method name implies other event types or standard events may be available through different methods. Worth testing with current/past dates to verify response structure with actual data. Consider testing Language values 1, 2 for different language responses. Month values 1-12, Year values should be tested for validation boundaries."}
