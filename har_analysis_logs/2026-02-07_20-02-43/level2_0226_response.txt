{"route_type":"POST /Routing/MakePostRequest","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - Specifies the backend method to invoke. LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier (1 appears to be default, likely Macedonian). Month (integer, required): Month number (1-12) for which to retrieve agenda. Year (integer, required): Four-digit year for the agenda query. Example tested: January 2026.","response_structure":"Empty response returned for the tested parameters (Month: 1, Year: 2026). This could indicate: no events scheduled for that period, future dates not yet populated, or the method requiring additional parameters. Expected structure likely JSON array/object containing parliamentary agenda items with dates, sessions, or events for the specified month/year when data exists.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic RPC-style routing endpoint where the actual API method is specified via the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. The MakePostRequest endpoint acts as a dispatcher/proxy to various backend methods. GetMonthlyAgenda appears designed to retrieve parliamentary calendar/agenda data for a specific month and year. The empty response for future date (2026) suggests data may only exist for current/past periods, or the service returns empty arrays for periods without scheduled events rather than error messages. Language support is built-in via LanguageId parameter.","other":"Pattern indicates a single-endpoint RPC architecture rather than RESTful design. Other potential methodName values likely exist for different data retrieval operations. The sobranie.mk domain suggests this is the North Macedonian Parliament (Sobranie) official website API. Testing with current/past dates would be needed to observe actual response structure with data. No authentication headers observed in this request, suggesting public API access for agenda information."}
