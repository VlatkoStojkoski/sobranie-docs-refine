{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetUserDetailsByStructure","parameters":"userId (UUID/GUID string, required) - Identifier for the user being queried; structureId (UUID/GUID string, required) - Identifier for the organizational/parliamentary structure; languageId (integer, required) - Language selection for localized content (1 appears to be default, likely Macedonian)","response_structure":"Empty response body returned in this capture. Expected structure unknown - may return user profile data, parliamentary membership details, committee assignments, or role information within the specified structure. Possible fields could include: name, position, biography, contact details, photo URL, term dates, party affiliation, committee memberships.","documentation_notes":"This endpoint uses a generic routing mechanism (/Routing/MakePostRequest) with methodName parameter to specify the actual operation (GetUserDetailsByStructure). This pattern suggests a single POST endpoint that routes to multiple backend methods. Empty response could indicate: (1) No data exists for this user-structure combination, (2) User has no active role in the specified structure, (3) Authentication/authorization required but missing, (4) Data sanitization removed all content. The method name suggests retrieving user details filtered or contextualized by a specific organizational structure (e.g., current parliament session, specific committee, administrative body). LanguageId parameter indicates multi-language support, likely for biographical and role description text.","other":"The sobranie.mk domain is the Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia. This API appears to be part of their internal content management or member information system. The generic routing pattern (/Routing/MakePostRequest) is unusual for modern REST APIs but common in older .NET/MVC frameworks or custom RPC-style implementations. All identifiers use UUID/GUID format suggesting SQL Server or similar backend. The combination of userId and structureId suggests a many-to-many relationship where users can belong to multiple structures and structures contain multiple users. Consider testing with different languageId values (2 for Albanian, 3 for English are possibilities for North Macedonia). Error handling, authentication requirements, and rate limiting are unknown from this single capture."}
