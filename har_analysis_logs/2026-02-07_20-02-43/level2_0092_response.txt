{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllStructuresForFilter","parameters":"methodName (string, required): The remote method to invoke - 'GetAllStructuresForFilter' in this case. languageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization, value 1 likely represents Macedonian as primary language. This is a generic RPC-style endpoint that routes to different backend methods.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (possibly no structures available, error condition, or authentication/session issue). Expected structure unknown but likely would contain filter structure definitions for parliamentary data based on method name - possibly organizational units, committees, working bodies, or document classification structures.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint (/Routing/MakePostRequest) that acts as an RPC gateway. The actual method being called (GetAllStructuresForFilter) suggests it retrieves structural/organizational filter options for the parliamentary system. The empty response may indicate: (1) no data available, (2) authentication required, (3) session validation failed, or (4) the method requires additional parameters not provided. The 'Filter' suffix suggests this provides options for filtering other queries. Language ID 1 pattern suggests multi-language support with numbered locale identifiers.","other":"This represents a non-RESTful RPC-over-HTTP pattern where a single POST endpoint routes to multiple backend methods. The sobranie.mk site (Assembly of North Macedonia parliament website) uses this architecture for dynamic content retrieval. Similar patterns likely exist for other GetAll*, Get*, Filter*, and data retrieval methods. Empty response with 200 OK status is unusual and warrants investigation - may need session cookies, CSRF tokens, or additional headers from actual browser context. Worth testing with authenticated session."}
