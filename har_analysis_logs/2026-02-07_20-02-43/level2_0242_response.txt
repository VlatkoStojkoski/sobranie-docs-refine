{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: Language (integer, value 1 observed), Month (integer, 1-12 range, value 1 observed for January), Year (integer, value 2026 observed). Language likely: 1=Macedonian, 2=Albanian based on common sobranie.mk patterns. Month and Year specify the calendar period to retrieve events for.","response_structure":"Empty response observed for January 2026 query, suggesting either no events scheduled for that period or the year 2026 is outside the available data range. Expected structure when data exists: likely JSON array of calendar event objects with properties such as event date, title, description, type, and potentially session/meeting details for parliamentary activities.","documentation_notes":"This is an ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET XML Web Services) that returns JSON. The 'GetCustomEventsCalendar' method retrieves parliamentary calendar events for a specific month/year in the requested language. The service is part of the Moldova subsection, which is the official name used for the North Macedonia parliament's digital services. Empty response may indicate: (1) no events in future date 2026, (2) calendar data not yet populated for distant future dates, or (3) service only returns current/past data. Test with current month/year for meaningful results.","other":"Service path structure: /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx/{MethodName}. This is a parliamentary calendar API for the Assembly of North Macedonia (Sobranie). The ASMX extension indicates legacy technology stack but modernized to return JSON instead of SOAP/XML. For API discovery: try current dates (2024-2025), test Language values 1 and 2, iterate through months 1-12. Related endpoints likely exist in CalendarService.asmx for other calendar operations (GetEvents, GetSessions, etc.). Consider testing GetWSDL or service description endpoints."}
