{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the remote method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): language identifier (1 appears to be default/Macedonian); Month (integer, required): month number (1-12), value 12 in example; Year (integer, required): four-digit year, value 2025 in example","response_structure":"Empty response returned in this capture. Expected structure likely contains calendar/agenda items for the specified month and year, possibly including parliamentary sessions, meetings, events, or scheduled activities. May return array of agenda items with dates, titles, descriptions, and metadata when data exists for the requested period.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic RPC-style endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that routes to different backend methods based on methodName parameter. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary calendar/agenda data for a specific month and year. Empty response may indicate no scheduled events for December 2025, or the future date returned no data. The routing pattern suggests multiple methods are available through this single endpoint. LanguageId parameter enables multilingual content retrieval. This appears to be part of the North Macedonia Parliament (Sobranie) website API for accessing legislative calendar information.","other":"The generic routing endpoint pattern (/Routing/MakePostRequest) is unusual and suggests a custom RPC implementation rather than RESTful design. Other potential methodName values should be discoverable through frontend JavaScript or additional HAR analysis. The empty response for a future date (December 2025) is expected behavior. Testing with current/past dates would likely return populated agenda data. Consider exploring other method names like GetDailyAgenda, GetWeeklyAgenda, or similar calendar-related functions. The sobranie.mk domain confirms this is the official Macedonian Parliament website."}
