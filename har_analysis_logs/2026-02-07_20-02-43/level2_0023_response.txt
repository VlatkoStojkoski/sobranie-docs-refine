{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. POST request with empty body. No query string parameters. Likely uses session/cookie data or headers to determine language context.","response_structure":"Empty JSON response (200 OK). Returns empty body, suggesting this is a state-setting endpoint that modifies server-side session state without returning data. Success indicated by 200 status code only.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure endpoint for language loading/initialization. Part of the /Infrastructure namespace which suggests system-level configuration. Empty response pattern indicates this is likely a setter/state modification endpoint rather than a data retrieval endpoint. May initialize language resources server-side, set language preferences in session, or load language-specific assets. The fact it returns empty suggests the actual language data may be cached or loaded separately, and this just triggers the loading process. Success/failure communicated through HTTP status code rather than response body.","other":"Endpoint pattern suggests multi-language support infrastructure. The empty response with 200 OK is unusual but indicates a fire-and-forget or state-setting operation. May need to be called before other API requests to ensure proper language context. Could be part of initialization sequence for the application. May rely on Accept-Language headers, cookies, or session tokens not visible in sanitized data. Consider testing with different language headers to observe behavior changes in subsequent requests."}
