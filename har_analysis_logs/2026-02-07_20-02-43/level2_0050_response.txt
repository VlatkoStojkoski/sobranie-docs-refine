{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value 1 observed), 'Month' (integer, value 9 for September), 'Year' (integer, value 2025). Language appears to be an enum where 1 likely represents a specific language option (possibly Macedonian or Albanian based on domain context). Month is 1-12 integer. Year is 4-digit integer.","response_structure":"Expected JSON array or object with calendar events, but response was empty in this capture. This could indicate: no events exist for September 2025, the date is too far in future, or the service returned legitimately empty data. Typical calendar event responses would contain event id, title, date, time, description, and possibly event type or category fields.","documentation_notes":"This is a SOAP-style web service (.asmx) exposed as JSON REST endpoint. The '/Moldova/' path segment suggests multi-tenancy or regional routing within the Sobranie (Parliament) system. The service retrieves custom/special events for a parliamentary calendar filtered by language, month, and year. Empty response suggests either no events scheduled or data not yet available for future dates. The 'Custom' in method name implies this fetches non-standard events, possibly excluding regular session schedules. Content-Type is application/json despite being an ASMX service, indicating JSON serialization is enabled.","other":"Domain sobranie.mk is the Assembly/Parliament of North Macedonia. Service appears to support multilingual content via Language parameter. The CalendarService.asmx suggests ASP.NET Web Services (.NET Framework) backend. Future dates (2025) being queried indicates the API accepts queries beyond current date. No authentication headers observed, suggesting public/anonymous access. No pagination parameters present, implying all events for the month are returned in single response. Consider testing Language values 0, 1, 2 to map to Macedonian/Albanian/English or similar."}
