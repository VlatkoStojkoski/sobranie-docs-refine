{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters in query string or request body. This appears to be a simple POST request without any payload. The endpoint may rely on session state, cookies, or headers (such as Accept-Language) to determine which language data to load.","response_structure":"Empty response body with HTTP 200 status. This suggests either: (1) the operation completed successfully but returns no data, (2) the response failed silently, or (3) language data may be loaded/cached server-side without client-side confirmation. Expected structure unknown due to empty response.","documentation_notes":"Infrastructure/LoadLanguage endpoint appears to be part of the website's internationalization (i18n) system. The 'Infrastructure' namespace suggests this is a utility/system-level endpoint rather than business logic. Method name 'LoadLanguage' indicates it handles language resource loading, likely for UI localization. The POST method is unusual for loading data (typically GET), which may indicate it triggers server-side state changes like setting session language preferences or initializing language resources. Empty response suggests fire-and-forget behavior or that language data is stored server-side in session. May need to examine cookies, session headers, or subsequent requests to understand full behavior.","other":"Endpoint pattern follows ASP.NET MVC conventions (Controller/Action structure). The empty response with 200 status is noteworthy - might indicate a cached response, a fire-and-forget operation, or potential error handling issues. To fully understand this endpoint, would need to: (1) check if subsequent requests receive localized content, (2) examine cookies/session data changes, (3) test with different Accept-Language headers, (4) verify if this is called during page initialization. May be part of AJAX-based language switching functionality."}
