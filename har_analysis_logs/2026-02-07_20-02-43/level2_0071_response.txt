{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - Specifies the backend method to invoke. LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier (1 observed, likely Macedonian or another primary language). Month (integer, required): Month number (1-12), value 1 observed for January. Year (integer, required): Four-digit year, value 2026 observed in test request.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (status 200). This could indicate: (1) No agenda items exist for January 2026, (2) Future dates beyond current legislative session return empty, (3) Valid request structure but no data available for requested period. Expected structure when data exists likely JSON array of agenda items with date/time, session details, topics, or participant information.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint that accepts different methodName values to invoke various backend methods. The GetMonthlyAgenda method retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar for a specific month and year. The empty response for January 2026 (future date) suggests either the calendar doesn't extend that far or no sessions are scheduled. Testing with current/past dates would reveal actual response structure. This pattern indicates a single-endpoint RPC-style API rather than RESTful design. LanguageId parameter suggests multi-language support in the API.","other":"The /Routing/MakePostRequest endpoint appears to be a unified gateway for multiple API methods, using methodName as discriminator. This is common in legacy or internally-developed systems. The sobranie.mk domain indicates this is the Assembly of North Macedonia's website. Other potential methodName values to discover: GetWeeklyAgenda, GetSessionDetails, GetLegislation, etc. Security consideration: No authentication observed in request. The 200 status with empty body (rather than 404) suggests graceful handling of no-data scenarios."}
