{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: 'Language' (integer, value 1 observed), 'Month' (integer, 1-12 range, value 1 observed for January), 'Year' (integer, value 2026 observed). No query parameters. Endpoint path: /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx/GetCustomEventsCalendar","response_structure":"Empty response body returned for this request. Expected structure unknown - likely returns array or object of calendar events when data exists. Content-Type is application/json suggesting structured data response when populated.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services). Part of Sobranie (Parliament) of North Macedonia system. Retrieves custom calendar events for specified month/year with language preference. Service namespace 'Moldova' suggests regional parliamentary context. Empty response for January 2026 indicates either no events scheduled or future date with no data. Language parameter 1 likely represents Macedonian language. Standard calendar filtering pattern with year/month granularity.","other":"Service technology: ASMX (older .NET web service, pre-WCF). Path structure indicates multiple service endpoints may exist under /Moldova/services/. CalendarService suggests related methods might exist (GetEvents, GetSessions, etc). Empty response could indicate: future date beyond data range, no events for that period, or potential error state. Request format uses nested 'model' wrapper which is typical of ASMX JSON endpoints. Consider testing with current/past dates to observe actual response structure."}
