{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "LoadLanguage", "parameters": "None - This endpoint accepts no query parameters or request body. It appears to be a POST request that retrieves language data based on implicit context (likely session, cookies, or server-side user preferences).", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned. This could indicate: (1) the language data was already cached/loaded, (2) an error occurred but was not properly reported, (3) the endpoint sets data server-side without returning content, or (4) the user's language preference was already set. Expected structure unknown - may return language configuration JSON in other scenarios.", "documentation_notes": "Infrastructure endpoint for language management in the Sobranie (Assembly of North Macedonia) website. The endpoint path '/Infrastructure/LoadLanguage' suggests it's part of the site's localization/internationalization system. Despite being a POST request, it accepts no parameters, which is unusual. The empty response may indicate this is used for initialization or state-setting purposes. The endpoint might rely on cookies, session data, or Accept-Language headers to determine which language to load. Typical use case would be during page load or language switching operations. May need to capture requests with different session states or language contexts to fully understand response variations.", "other": "Endpoint pattern suggests ASP.NET MVC or similar framework structure with 'Infrastructure' as controller and 'LoadLanguage' as action. The empty response is notable - production APIs typically return success indicators or loaded data. This might be a legacy endpoint, or the HAR capture may have occurred during an error state. Consider testing with different language cookies (mk for Macedonian, sq for Albanian, en for English) to see varying responses. Related endpoints to investigate: /Infrastructure/SetLanguage, /Infrastructure/GetLanguage. The sobranie.mk domain suggests official government website, so documentation may not be publicly available."}
