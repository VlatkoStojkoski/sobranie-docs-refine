{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"Required: model object containing: Language (integer, value 1 observed), Month (integer, 1-12 range expected, value 1 observed), Year (integer, 4-digit year, value 2026 observed). All parameters appear to be required fields within the model object. Request Content-Type is application/json.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned (possibly indicating no events for the specified date range). Expected structure unknown but likely returns calendar events array when data exists. Response Content-Type is application/json.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services). Path structure suggests multi-tenant or localized application (/Moldova/ prefix). Service name 'CalendarService' indicates calendar-related functionality. Method retrieves custom events for a specific month/year. Language parameter suggests multi-language support (1 likely represents a specific language code, possibly Macedonian or English). The empty response for January 2026 could indicate: no events scheduled, future date with no data, or potential error condition that returns empty rather than null/error message.","other":"Service technology: ASP.NET ASMX (Application Server Methods eXtension) - older web service framework, typically SOAP-based but this endpoint accepts/returns JSON. Domain: sobranie.mk (Sobranie is the Assembly/Parliament of North Macedonia). The /Moldova/ path segment is interesting - possibly refers to a specific section, region, or historical context. Request was made for a future date (2026), suggesting the calendar may support long-term planning or the request was part of testing. No authentication headers observed in the sanitized request. Consider testing with different Language values (0, 2, 3, etc.) and current/past dates to understand full API behavior."}
