{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"LoadLanguage","parameters":"No parameters required. This is a POST request to /Infrastructure/LoadLanguage with no request body, no query parameters, and no visible headers beyond standard HTTP headers.","response_structure":"Empty response body with 200 OK status. Content-Type is application/json but the actual response appears to be empty or null. This suggests either: (1) the endpoint sets language preferences server-side via cookies/session without returning data, (2) the response may contain only HTTP headers with language settings, or (3) this is a no-op endpoint that acknowledges the request without content.","documentation_notes":"This appears to be an infrastructure/utility endpoint for language handling on the Macedonian Parliament website (sobranie.mk). The endpoint name 'LoadLanguage' suggests it may be used to initialize or switch language settings for the user session. Given the empty response, this likely works through server-side session management or cookie setting rather than returning language data to the client. The endpoint may be called during page initialization or language switching. To fully document this endpoint, capture would need to include: response headers (especially Set-Cookie), any authentication tokens, and context about when this is called in the application flow.","other":"The empty response with successful 200 status is notable - typical language loading endpoints would return language strings, locale codes, or configuration data. This suggests the endpoint may serve a different purpose than its name implies, possibly: session initialization, language preference persistence, or a legacy endpoint. The Infrastructure namespace suggests this is part of core application functionality. Further analysis should examine: (1) what cookies or session data are set in response headers, (2) whether subsequent requests reflect language changes, (3) if there are related endpoints like GetLanguage or SetLanguage that work in conjunction with this one."}
