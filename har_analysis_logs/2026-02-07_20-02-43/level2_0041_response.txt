{"route_type":"POST /Routing/MakePostRequest","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - identifies the backend method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): language selection (1 appears to be default, likely Macedonian based on .mk domain); Month (integer, required): month number 1-12 for agenda retrieval; Year (integer, required): four-digit year for agenda retrieval","response_structure":"Empty response body returned for this request. This could indicate: (1) no agenda items exist for January 2026, (2) future dates return empty results, (3) authentication/session required but missing, or (4) the endpoint exists but has no data for the requested period. Expected structure when data exists is unknown but likely contains parliamentary session/meeting information given the method name and sobranie.mk (North Macedonia Parliament) context.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint that dispatches to different backend methods based on the 'methodName' parameter - a common RPC-style pattern. The GetMonthlyAgenda method retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar data for a specific month and year. The empty response for January 2026 (a future date at time of analysis) suggests the system may only return historical or current data. To discover valid data ranges, test with current/past dates. The LanguageId parameter suggests multi-language support - test with values 1, 2, 3 to identify available languages (likely Macedonian, Albanian, English based on North Macedonia's official languages). This routing pattern indicates other methods likely exist - monitor network traffic for additional methodName values.","other":"Domain context: sobranie.mk is the Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia. This appears to be part of their legislative tracking system. The RPC-style architecture with /Routing/MakePostRequest suggests a centralized dispatch mechanism rather than RESTful design. Security note: no authentication tokens observed in this request, suggesting public access or session cookies. Testing recommendations: (1) try Month values 1-12 with current/past years to find valid data, (2) enumerate other methodName values by monitoring HAR captures, (3) test LanguageId values 1-3 for language variants, (4) check if future dates always return empty or if there's a cutoff threshold."}
