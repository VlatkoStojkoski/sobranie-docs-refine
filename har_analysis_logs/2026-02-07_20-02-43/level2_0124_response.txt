{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetAllSittings","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetAllSittings' - specifies the backend method to invoke; Page (integer, required): pagination page number, starts at 1; Rows (integer, required): number of results per page, set to 10; LanguageId (integer, required): language identifier, 1 likely represents Macedonian; TypeId (integer, required): type filter identifier, value 1 indicates a specific sitting type; CommitteeId (integer, nullable): optional filter for committee-specific sittings; StatusId (integer, nullable): optional filter for sitting status; DateFrom (string/date, nullable): optional start date filter for date range queries; DateTo (string/date, nullable): optional end date filter for date range queries; SessionId (integer, nullable): optional filter for parliamentary session; Number (integer, nullable): optional filter for sitting number; StructureId (string/UUID, required): unique identifier for organizational structure, format is UUID (5e00dbd6-ca3c-4d97-b748-f792b2fa3473)","response_structure":"Empty response body returned. This may indicate: (1) no sittings match the specified criteria, (2) an error occurred but was not properly communicated, (3) the endpoint returned successfully but with no data for the given filters, or (4) authentication/authorization issue preventing data retrieval. Expected structure would likely be a JSON object containing an array of sitting records with pagination metadata.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a gateway/dispatcher to multiple backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the POST body. This architectural pattern allows the frontend to call various backend methods through a single HTTP endpoint. The GetAllSittings method appears designed to retrieve parliamentary sitting records with extensive filtering capabilities including date ranges, committee selection, status, session, and organizational structure. The pagination parameters (Page, Rows) suggest the API supports paginated results. The StructureId UUID suggests a multi-tenant or organizational hierarchy system. The empty response in this capture requires further investigation to determine if this is normal behavior for no results or indicates an issue.","other":"The routing pattern used here (/Routing/MakePostRequest with methodName in body) is unusual compared to RESTful conventions. This suggests a legacy system or a custom framework. Additional API discovery should test: (1) different methodName values to discover other available methods, (2) varying LanguageId to determine supported languages, (3) different TypeId values to understand sitting type classifications, (4) populated nullable fields to observe filtering behavior, (5) different StructureId values to map organizational hierarchy. The UUID format for StructureId suggests this might correspond to specific parliamentary bodies, committees, or administrative divisions within the Macedonian Assembly."}
