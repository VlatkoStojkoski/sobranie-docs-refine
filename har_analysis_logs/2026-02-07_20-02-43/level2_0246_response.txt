{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the remote method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): language identifier (1 observed, likely Macedonian as primary language); Month (integer, required): month number 1-12 for agenda retrieval; Year (integer, required): four-digit year for agenda retrieval (2026 tested, suggesting future date support)","response_structure":"Empty response body returned for the test request (2026-01-01). This suggests either: (1) no agenda items exist for future dates, (2) the endpoint returns empty array/null when no data exists, or (3) the service may have validation that rejects unrealistic future dates. Normal responses likely return JSON array of agenda items with date, title, description, and event details for parliamentary sessions and activities.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic RPC-style endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a router/dispatcher for multiple backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the POST body. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar items for a specific month and year. The empty response for January 2026 indicates either no scheduled events or potential data validation. Testing with current/past dates would reveal actual response structure. This pattern suggests other methods may be callable through the same endpoint by changing methodName.","other":"The routing pattern indicates a backend architecture where a single endpoint multiplexes multiple API methods. This is common in legacy or internal systems. To discover other available methods, look for: (1) other methodName values in HAR captures, (2) JavaScript files that construct these requests, (3) similar POST requests to /Routing/MakePostRequest with different methodName values. The LanguageId parameter suggests multi-language support - testing with different IDs (1, 2, etc.) may reveal content in Albanian, English, or other languages. Month/Year validation boundaries should be tested (e.g., Month 0, 13, historical dates)."}
