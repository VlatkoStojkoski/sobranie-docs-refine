{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - specifies the remote method to invoke; LanguageId (integer, required): 1 for primary language (likely Macedonian), appears to support language switching; Month (integer, required): 1-12 representing calendar month; Year (integer, required): 4-digit year value, tested with 2026","response_structure":"Empty response body returned for January 2026, suggesting either no agenda items exist for this future date, or the endpoint returns empty array/null when no data is available. Expected structure likely JSON array of agenda/event objects when data exists, potentially containing fields like date, time, title, description, session type, participants, or meeting details","documentation_notes":"This is a generic RPC-style POST endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a routing layer for multiple backend methods. The actual method invoked is determined by the 'methodName' parameter in the request body. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary agenda/schedule for a specific month and year. The empty response for a future date (2026) suggests the system may not have data beyond current legislative periods, or returns empty for dates without scheduled sessions. LanguageId parameter indicates multilingual support for the Macedonian parliament website","other":"API follows RPC pattern rather than RESTful design. Single endpoint handles multiple operations via methodName discriminator. Similar pattern likely used for other parliamentary data methods. Future testing should include: current/past dates to verify response structure with actual data, different LanguageId values (try 2 for Albanian, 3 for English if supported), edge cases like invalid months (0, 13) or historical years. Consider this endpoint may support additional methodName values like GetDailyAgenda, GetSessionDetails, GetLegislativeCalendar, etc. Security note: no authentication observed, appears to be public data access"}
