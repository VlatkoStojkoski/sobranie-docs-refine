{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - Specifies the API method to invoke. LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier, value 1 observed (likely Macedonian or primary language). Month (integer, required): Month number 1-12, tested with value 1 (January). Year (integer, required): Four-digit year, tested with 2026.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned for the tested request (January 2026). Expected structure likely contains array of agenda items/events for the specified month when data exists. Response format is JSON based on Content-Type header. Possible fields may include: date, event title, description, session type, documents, participants, or meeting details. Empty response suggests no scheduled events for future date or the month has no agenda items yet.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic POST routing endpoint that acts as an RPC-style gateway. The actual method is specified via the 'methodName' parameter in the request body rather than the URL path. The endpoint follows a pattern where /Routing/MakePostRequest serves as a universal entry point for multiple backend methods. GetMonthlyAgenda appears to retrieve parliamentary agenda/calendar data for a specific month and year. The empty response for January 2026 (a future date at time of analysis) suggests either: (1) no events scheduled that far in advance, (2) the system only returns data for past/current periods, or (3) the agenda hasn't been populated yet. Testing with current or past dates would likely yield populated results. LanguageId=1 suggests multilingual support in the Macedonian Parliament system.","other":"Parliament website API (sobranie.mk - Assembly of North Macedonia). RPC-style architecture using a single routing endpoint. The methodology differs from RESTful patterns. Consider testing with current month/year or recent past dates to observe actual data structure. May be part of a larger suite of methods accessible through the same routing endpoint. Could explore other methodName values like GetDailyAgenda, GetSessionDetails, GetLegislation, etc. The empty response prevents full schema documentation but suggests calendar/scheduling functionality for parliamentary activities."}
