{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "GetAllStructuresForFilter", "parameters": "methodName: string (required, value: 'GetAllStructuresForFilter'), languageId: integer (required, value: 1 for Macedonian language selection)", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned (status 200). Expected structure unknown - may return array of structure objects with filtering metadata when data is available, or this could indicate no structures exist for the given language filter.", "documentation_notes": "This is a generic routing endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that acts as a dispatcher to backend methods. The actual method invoked is 'GetAllStructuresForFilter' which suggests it retrieves organizational or hierarchical structures (likely parliamentary committees, working bodies, or administrative structures) that can be used for filtering purposes. The languageId parameter indicates multi-language support. Empty response may indicate: no structures configured, database query returned no results, or possible error condition masked by 200 status. This endpoint pattern suggests a single-entry-point API design where all POST requests go through the same route and are dispatched internally based on methodName.", "other": "Domain: sobranie.mk (Macedonian Parliament website). The routing pattern /Routing/MakePostRequest suggests a .NET/ASP.NET backend architecture with centralized request handling. This is part of a filtering system, likely used to populate dropdown menus or filter options in the UI. The empty response with 200 OK status is unusual - may warrant investigation whether this is expected behavior or if the method requires additional parameters not shown here.
