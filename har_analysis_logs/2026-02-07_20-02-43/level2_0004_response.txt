{"route_type": "POST", "method_name": "GetAllStructuresForFilter", "parameters": "methodName (string, required): The RPC method to invoke, value 'GetAllStructuresForFilter'. languageId (integer, required): Language identifier for localization, value 1 likely represents Macedonian or primary language.", "response_structure": "Empty response body returned. Expected structure unknown - may return array of structure objects with filtering metadata when data is available, or endpoint may be deprecated/non-functional. Typical structure response would include id, name, type fields for organizational structures.", "documentation_notes": "This is an RPC-style endpoint using POST to /Routing/MakePostRequest as a gateway. The actual method invoked is specified in the request body's methodName field. This pattern suggests a centralized routing mechanism where multiple API methods are accessed through a single endpoint. The method GetAllStructuresForFilter implies retrieval of organizational structures (committees, working bodies, parliamentary groups) with filtering capabilities. Empty response may indicate no structures match current filter criteria, authentication required, or the endpoint is not properly configured. This endpoint appears to support the filtering UI components on the sobranie.mk website.", "other": "Part of a larger RPC-style API architecture. Other methods likely follow similar pattern through same /Routing/MakePostRequest endpoint. The languageId parameter suggests multilingual support (Macedonian/Albanian). Consider testing with languageId values 1, 2 to determine language mappings. Empty response prevents reverse-engineering full data structure. Recommend capturing traffic when filters are actively used or data is present to document complete response schema."}
