{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetCustomEventsCalendar","parameters":"JSON body with 'model' object containing: (1) Language - integer, likely language ID (value: 1), (2) Month - integer for month number 1-12 (value: 1 for January), (3) Year - integer for year (value: 2026). No query parameters. Content-Type appears to be application/json.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned with 200 OK status. Expected structure unknown - may return calendar events array when data exists, or empty response may indicate no events for requested period (January 2026). Content-Type is application/json suggesting JSON response format when data present.","documentation_notes":"ASMX web service endpoint (legacy ASP.NET Web Services). Part of CalendarService at /Moldova/services/CalendarService.asmx. Method retrieves custom calendar events filtered by language, month, and year. Empty response for future date (2026) suggests either no events scheduled or method only returns past/current events. Language parameter value 1 likely represents Macedonian or primary site language. Service follows ASMX convention with method name in URL path.","other":"Domain sobranie.mk is the Assembly (Parliament) of North Macedonia. Path '/Moldova/' in URL is notable - may indicate content management structure or historical naming. ASMX is legacy Microsoft technology (pre-WCF), suggests older codebase. Future testing should try: current year/month for populated data, different Language values (0, 2, etc.), boundary conditions for Month (0, 13) and various Year values. Related endpoints likely exist in same CalendarService.asmx for other calendar operations."}
