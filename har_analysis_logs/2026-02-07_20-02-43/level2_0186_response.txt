{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetSittingDetails","parameters":"SittingId (UUID string, required): Unique identifier for a parliamentary sitting session (e.g., 'd026cd07-0525-494f-a179-7785005e06b7'); LanguageId (integer, required): Language selector for localization, 1 appears to be default language (likely Macedonian); MethodName (string, required): RPC-style method identifier within the routing framework","response_structure":"Empty response returned in this capture. Expected structure unknown but likely contains sitting details such as date, time, agenda items, participants, voting records, transcripts, or session metadata. Response format is JSON based on Content-Type header.","documentation_notes":"This is an RPC-style API using a generic routing endpoint '/Routing/MakePostRequest' where the actual method is specified in the request body. The sobranie.mk parliament website uses this pattern to access various parliamentary data methods. The GetSittingDetails method retrieves information about a specific parliamentary sitting session. The empty response may indicate: (1) the sitting ID doesn't exist, (2) authentication/authorization issue, (3) the sitting has no published details yet, or (4) an error occurred. The LanguageId parameter suggests multi-language support, with 1 likely representing Macedonian and possibly 2 for Albanian or English.","other":"URL pattern suggests a routing controller that dispatches to multiple methods. This is likely part of a larger API with many MethodName values available. The SittingId uses UUID format indicating a modern database structure. To discover other methods, inspect additional HAR captures for different MethodName values. The API appears to be internal/undocumented as it uses non-RESTful RPC patterns. Consider testing with different LanguageId values (1, 2, 3) to determine available languages. The empty response in production suggests error handling may not return descriptive messages."}
