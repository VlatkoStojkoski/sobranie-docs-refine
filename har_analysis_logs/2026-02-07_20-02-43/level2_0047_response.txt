{"route_type":"POST","method_name":"GetMonthlyAgenda","parameters":"methodName (string, required): 'GetMonthlyAgenda' - Specifies the remote method to invoke. LanguageId (integer, required): Language identifier (1 appears to be Macedonian/default language). Month (integer, required): Month number (1-12), example shows 10 for October. Year (integer, required): Four-digit year, example shows 2025.","response_structure":"Empty response body returned in this capture. Expected structure unknown but likely would contain array of agenda items/events for the specified month when data exists. Status 200 indicates successful request processing despite empty payload.","documentation_notes":"This is a generic RPC-style endpoint at /Routing/MakePostRequest that routes to different backend methods based on the 'methodName' parameter. GetMonthlyAgenda retrieves parliamentary agenda/calendar events for a specific month and year. The empty response suggests either no agenda items exist for October 2025, or the future date has no scheduled items yet. Similar pattern likely used for other parliament data retrieval methods. Language selection via LanguageId enables multilingual support.","other":"RPC/command pattern endpoint rather than RESTful design. Single POST endpoint handles multiple operations via methodName dispatcher. Future date queried (2025) suggests system allows viewing planned/scheduled events. Authentication not evident from this request. Consider testing with current/past dates to observe typical response structure with data. May return null, empty array, or structured calendar data when events exist."}
