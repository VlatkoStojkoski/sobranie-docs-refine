You are given current API documentation (global conventions + per-operation doc) and one real request/response pair from the Sobranie.mk parliament API. Analyze the pair against the docs and produce concise notes.

WHAT TO NOTE:
- New fields not in the schema → add as optional properties
- Field values that reveal new enum values → note for global $defs
- Fields that can be null but aren't marked nullable → note anyOf with null
- Fields with different types than documented → note union type
- Inaccurate descriptions → note correction with evidence from the pair
- Unnecessary verbosity in docs that can be simplified → note simplification
- Behavior the pair reveals that isn't documented (e.g. empty array vs null, language fallback, date format quirks)

RULES:
- Only WIDEN, never narrow. Don't remove enum values, don't make optional fields required, don't drop anyOf branches.
- Enum values belong in global $defs; op docs use $ref.
- Operation-specific details go in op doc, not global.
- Global has only: conventions, $defs, patterns common to many operations.
- Be precise and actionable. Each note should say exactly what to change and where.
- If the pair adds nothing new beyond what's already documented: output exactly "No changes needed."
