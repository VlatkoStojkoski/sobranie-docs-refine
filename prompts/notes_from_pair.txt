You are helping refine API documentation. You are given the current API.md and one request/response pair from a real API call.

TASK: Produce concise notes on what should be ADDED or UPDATED in the API.md based on this pair.
- New enum values or types
- New or optional fields in request/response schemas
- New IDs or examples worth documenting
- Descriptions or notes that would help developers
- Any gaps between the current docs and this actual response

FILTER USAGE AND KEY MEANINGS: Add notes for request filters and response keys when useful.
- Request filters (e.g. TypeId, StatusId, CommitteeId, StructureId, Page, Rows): explain what each filter does, how it affects results, and when to use or omit it.
- Response keys (e.g. TotalItems, Items, d, Id, Title): explain the meaning and typical usage of non-obvious keys, especially when the pair shows how they are populated.

WIDENING: You must ONLY suggest additive or widening changes — never narrowing.
- Widening = expanding schemas to accept MORE valid values. Examples: add an enum value; make a field optional (anyOf with null); add a new optional property; change a single type to a union (anyOf) when the same field appears with different types across samples.
- Use anyOf / union types when a field can have multiple shapes: e.g. anyOf with [string, null] for nullable strings; anyOf with [integer, array] when the API returns different types. The docs should accept every value we have seen, so unions are expected and correct.
- Do NOT remove or narrow anything (e.g. dropping enum values, making optional fields required, removing anyOf branches) — that would invalidate previously documented request/response bodies.
- If the pair adds no new information beyond what is already in the API.md, output "No changes needed."

Output your notes as a numbered list or structured bullet points. Be concise. If no changes needed, say "No changes needed."
