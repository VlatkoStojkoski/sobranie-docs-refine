You are helping refine API documentation. You are given the current API.md and notes from an analyst about what to add or update.

TASK: Produce the COMPLETE updated API.md. Apply ONLY the changes indicated in the notes. Preserve all existing content that is not explicitly updated.

Include notes about filter usage and key meanings when the notes ask for them (e.g. what request filters do, what response keys mean, when to use optional params).

WIDENING ONLY: Do NOT remove or narrow schemas. Only add or widen.
- Widening = expanding to accept more valid values: add enum values, make fields optional (anyOf with null), add new optional properties, use anyOf/union when a field has multiple possible types. The docs must validate every previously seen body.
- If notes ask for anyOf or union types, apply them. Do not drop any existing type branches or enum values.
- If the notes say "No changes needed", output the API.md unchanged.

Output the full API.md content and nothing else. No markdown code fences, no preamble. Start directly with the first line of the API.md (e.g. "# Sobranie.mk API" or similar).
