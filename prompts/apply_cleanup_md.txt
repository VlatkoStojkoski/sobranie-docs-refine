You are cleaning up Sobranie.mk API documentation. You receive ONLY the existing markdown (global.md + per-operation doc). No request/response samples, no analyst notes. Use this context to clean up precisely.

RULES

**Global scope (truly global):**
- Put a note in global only if it applies to at least half of the operations, or is a mechanism (base URLs, method name / parameter casing, date format, LanguageId, StructureId, pagination style, enums in $defs). Anything that applies only to this operation or to 1–2 operations belongs in the per-operation doc, not in global.
- When in doubt, put the content in new_op. Global should stay short (e.g. a few sections: Calling Conventions, Parameter Casing, $defs, Common patterns, Operations index).
- Your new_global will be merged with new_global from all other operations; only exact duplicate lines are removed. Do not add operation-specific notes to new_global—they would accumulate. Put them in new_op.

**Global (new_global):**
- Keep global MINIMAL, SIMPLE, and DIRECT. new_global must be the minimal shared document; prefer putting content in new_op when in doubt.
- Global MUST contain:
  - All enums and enum descriptions. Enums MUST exist ONLY in global (no enum definitions in per-op docs).
  - Short notes on general API workings (calling conventions, base URLs, parameter casing).
  - Common patterns that apply across multiple operations (e.g. pagination, date format, LanguageId).
- Global must NOT contain:
  - Operation-specific or lengthy detail.
  - Notes that apply only to one or two operations (e.g. "GetAllInstitutionsForFilter may return placeholder titles" or "GetAllProcedureTypes may return Macedonian regardless of languageId"). Put those in new_op.
  - Duplicate bullets (deduplicate; one canonical line per idea).
  - Per-operation request/response schemas or filter lists that belong to a single op.
- Use clear ## section headers (e.g. ## Calling Conventions, ## $defs, ## Common patterns, ## Common request filters, ## Common response keys). Deduplicate sections.

**Per-operation doc (new_op) — required template:**
- Structure (exactly three sections after the ## OperationName heading):
  1. **### Request Schema** — JSON Schema for the request body only. Use $ref to global $defs for enums and shared types (e.g. "#/$defs/LanguageId", "#/$defs/UUID"). Include type, properties, required, and description where they add clarity.
  2. **### Response Schema** — JSON Schema for the response body only. Use $ref to global $defs. Include type, properties, items where applicable, required, and description where helpful.
  3. **### Notes** — Operation-specific notes only: parameter casing (methodName vs MethodName, etc.), data quality quirks, language/fallback behavior, usage hints, pagination style. No enum definitions; reference global. Short pointers to global when relevant (e.g. "Uses common Page/Rows; see global.").
- Level of detail: HIGH. Document every field and behavior that is known. Schemas must be valid for all observed/documented request and response bodies (use anyOf/optional when the API allows multiple shapes). Enums and shared types only via $ref to global—no inline enum definitions. Be precise and informative but use the simplest wording that still gets all details through.
- Must NOT contain: enum definitions (reference global $defs only); long copy-paste from global; bare Request/Response example blocks without a Schema (we use Request Schema and Response Schema as the contract). Do not invent schema details beyond what exists in the current op doc and global.

**raisePossibleIssueToHuman:**
- Put here anything suspicious or worth human review in the existing docs only, e.g.:
  - Inconsistency between global and op doc, or within the op doc.
  - Enum or pattern mentioned in text but missing from $defs.
  - Ambiguous or underspecified behavior in the written text.
- If nothing to flag, output an empty string "".

## Current per-operation doc: {operation}

{op_md}

Produce exactly three outputs: new_global (the minimal shared global.md: conventions, $defs, common patterns only; no op-specific content; entire document content for global), new_op (full per-operation .md content), raisePossibleIssueToHuman (string; empty if nothing to flag). No markdown fences, no preamble.
