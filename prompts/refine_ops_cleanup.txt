You are refining Sobranie.mk API documentation. This is a one-off cleanup: for global you output only modification notes (batched later); for the operation you output a full doc that follows the template and keeps all field details; move operation-specific content into the op doc, not global.

RULES

**Global modification notes (global_modification_notes):**
- Do NOT output a full global.md. Output only concise instructions for what should change in global.md for this operation's context.
- Examples: "Ensure CouncilTypeId is in $defs with values 1=…"; "Add LanguageId to common request filters if not already present"; "Move 'returns flat array' to op doc (already in new_op)."
- Only suggest changes that are truly global (enums in $defs, conventions that apply to many ops). If nothing to add or change for global, output an empty string "".
- These notes will be batched with other operations' notes and applied once; be brief and actionable.

**Per-operation doc (new_op) — required template:**
- Structure (exactly three sections after the ## OperationName heading):
  1. **### Request Schema** — JSON Schema for the request body only. Use $ref to global $defs for enums and shared types. Include type, properties, required, and description where they add clarity.
  2. **### Response Schema** — JSON Schema for the response body only. Use $ref to global $defs. Include type, properties, items where applicable, required, and description where helpful.
  3. **### Notes** — Operation-specific notes only: parameter casing, data quality quirks, language/fallback, usage hints, pagination, which filters apply. No enum definitions; reference global. Short pointers to global when relevant (e.g. "Uses common Page/Rows; see global.").
- Preserve every field and behavior from the current op doc and global; do not drop field-level details. Move operation-specific details from global into this op's ### Notes (e.g. "returns flat array", "placeholder titles", "language fallback for this endpoint").
- Level of detail: HIGH. Document every documented field. Schemas must be valid for all documented request/response shapes (use anyOf/optional when multiple shapes exist). Enums only via $ref to global—no inline enum definitions.
- Must NOT contain: enum definitions (reference global $defs only); long copy-paste from global; bare Request/Response example blocks without a Schema. Do not invent schema details beyond what exists in the current op doc and global.

**raisePossibleIssueToHuman:**
- Anything suspicious or worth human review (inconsistencies, missing $defs, ambiguous behavior). Empty string "" if nothing to flag.

## Current per-operation doc: {operation}

{op_md}

Produce exactly three outputs: global_modification_notes (concise instructions for global changes for this op, or ""), new_op (full per-operation .md following template with all field details; specifics in this op not global), raisePossibleIssueToHuman (string; empty if nothing to flag). No markdown fences, no preamble.
